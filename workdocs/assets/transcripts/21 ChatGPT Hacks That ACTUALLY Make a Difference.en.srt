1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,959
everyone uses chat GPT but not to its

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:03,679
full potential most people are only

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,560
scratching the surface and even power

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,279
users won't know some of the tricks I'm

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,230
about to

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,360
[Music]

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,920
share ever wish you had an incognito

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,480
mode for chat GPT turn on temporary chat

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,240
go up to the model list then click

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,279
temporary chat now anything you say

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,240
won't show up in your history open AI

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,519
won't train their models with the

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,279
information and it won't be added to

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,960
Memories definitely use that if you're

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,080
mentioning any proprietary or sensitive

16
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,039
data or I like use it for just random

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,920
one-off questions I know I'll never need

18
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,360
again that way I don't have as much

19
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,879
nonsense filling up the history in the

20
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,640
sidebar that way it's easier to go back

21
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,800
to previous chats or there's an even

22
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,719
easier way to find previous chats if you

23
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,239
ever had the moment where you know you

24
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:44,960
had a conversation but can't remember

25
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
what it was titled or when it happened

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
to find it you can use search in the top

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,640
left or what I prefer is type command K

28
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,719
on a Mac and control K on Windows then

29
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,160
you can type in whatever it was you were

30
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,719
chatting about and it will show chat

31
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,359
titles and Snippets from all your

32
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,320
previous chats about that topic then you

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,280
can click in for the full chat it's

34
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,879
super convenient I've been using chat

35
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:06,560
GPT regularly for a long time so I use

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,560
that a lot if you want to save time and

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,040
maneuver through chat GPT like a pro hit

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
command forward slash to pull up the

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,840
full list of shortcuts I use a few of

40
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,000
these consistently command shift C to

41
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,720
copy the last response if you need to

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,479
save it to a notepad or drafting an

43
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,479
email or something command shift o to

44
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,040
open a new chat and command shift s to

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,960
toggle the sidebar is really nice to

46
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,159
have a clean interface while you're

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,960
chatting those make my workflow much

48
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,320
smoother there may be others you want to

49
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,360
use in here too like command shift I to

50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,000
access custom instructions so you can

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
quickly turn them on or off or make

52
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,399
changes to them another short cut that's

53
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,040
not listed in here is when you're in a

54
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,840
chat you can hit forward slash and that

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,720
will pull up a list of actions you can

56
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,560
move up and down with the arrow keys to

57
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,159
select generate an image search the web

58
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,000
use the reasoning model there's also the

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,880
box down below but I prefer the shortcut

60
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,200
so my hand doesn't have to leave the

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,840
keyboard let's use search really quick

62
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,520
the updated search feature is just so

63
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,439
much better so I want to see some maps

64
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,200
during the Roman Empire

65
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,159
now it displays multiple images I can

66
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,439
click

67
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
through then there's clickable sources

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
within the chat for further reading and

69
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,239
if you click sources at the bottom it

70
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,959
will pull them all up on the side this

71
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,040
is awesome you can pull up anything then

72
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,680
continue chatting about it all in one

73
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,480
interface and now this is much more

74
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
directly competing with perplexity and

75
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,440
Google Chach PT is pretty good at using

76
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,680
search when needed but not always so

77
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,120
just remember to ask it to search

78
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,160
anytime you need updated information or

79
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,640
reprompt it if it comes back and seems

80
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,360
like search could have been beneficial

81
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,519
this list of AI robotics advancements

82
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,480
doesn't seem fully up to dat so I'll ask

83
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,440
it for more recent

84
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
examples and those look

85
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,120
perfect now chat GPT might know you

86
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,920
better than you think if memory is

87
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,280
enabled chat GPT remembers details about

88
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,599
you there's this fun prompt that was

89
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,920
going around from all of our

90
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,560
interactions what is one thing that you

91
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,680
can tell me about myself that I may not

92
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,640
know about myself it usually gives a

93
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,680
pretty fun response and that showcases

94
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,239
how much it can learn about you but

95
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,800
along the way it picks up a bunch of

96
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,000
random often useless facts that clog up

97
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,879
its memory you can see and change what

98
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,239
it remembers by going to your profile

99
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,720
then settings then personalization

100
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,239
that's where memory is you can turn it

101
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,440
off completely or click manage to remove

102
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,840
things you don't want so just any

103
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,400
useless or outdated information you can

104
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
remove help finding a book for my

105
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,319
four-year-old don't really need that a

106
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,040
specific b-roll clip I needed help

107
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,799
finding definitely don't need that there

108
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,519
will usually be a lot you can clear out

109
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,159
here mine tends to be things from

110
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,959
previous videos I was working on

111
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,599
sometimes I ask things just for testing

112
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,280
purposes or for someone else it's

113
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
definitely helpful to get rid of that

114
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,480
stuff and only keep what's relevant also

115
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,120
if you do want it to remember something

116
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,959
during your chats you can say remember

117
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,760
this at any point and it will add that

118
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,799
like I had a daughter on Halloween that

119
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,400
will probably be relevant to some future

120
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,040
chats I'm covering a lot of hacks and

121
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,879
lesser known features but another

122
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,560
incredibly time-saving technique is

123
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,079
using prompt templates thanks to HubSpot

124
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,120
there's a list of 1,000 prompts for

125
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,760
marketing and productivity you can

126
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,239
download for free from the link in the

127
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,799
description I've definitely struggled

128
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,560
trying to come up with the right words

129
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,799
or approach for prompts many times so

130
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,480
this list is super helpful and those

131
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,319
1,000 prompts are broken down into

132
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
categories to make it more efficient to

133
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,959
navigate and easy to find the perfect

134
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,920
prompt it has categories like marketing

135
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,120
strategy copywriting social media

136
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,279
strategy competitor analysis

137
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,720
productivity and a bunch more there's 18

138
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,400
different categories you just copy and

139
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,960
paste then there's usually a few Fields

140
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,919
you can customize to your industry or

141
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,919
goals these are well researched and

142
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,960
tailored to give actionable responses

143
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,400
like having your own personal

144
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,199
productivity assistant so again that's

145
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,600
completely free to download from the

146
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,120
link in the description it can save you

147
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,960
a ton of time and help you craft

148
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,160
strategies and generate ideas so thank

149
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,600
you to HubSpot for sponsoring this video

150
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,880
back in that same spot right above

151
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,680
memory is custom instructions which are

152
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,280
a little different I think of memory

153
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,000
like having a personal assistant who

154
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,919
remembers your preferences and history

155
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,680
over time than custom instructions are

156
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,360
like giving specific directions for how

157
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,080
you want that assistant to act in the

158
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
moment and across all chats I keep mine

159
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,280
pretty basic just a few things about me

160
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,080
up top then the section about how you'd

161
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,960
like Chachi PT to respond I start with

162
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,160
asking it not to give as many

163
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
disclaimers and just assume I'm aware of

164
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,320
General precautions that way it's not as

165
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,720
Naggy also I ask it to be concise unless

166
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,280
asked otherwise not to apologize and to

167
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,520
prioritize corrections I don't go beyond

168
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,000
that because that's all I want applied

169
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,800
universally to every chat but if there's

170
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
ever any little annoyances you find keep

171
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,199
popping up see if you can get rid of

172
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,960
them here another housekeeping tip back

173
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,759
in these three dots you can also archive

174
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,360
that's different from deleting that will

175
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,840
remove it from your history to clean it

176
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,280
up a bit but it will still pull up if

177
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,880
you search for

178
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,479
it can find all your archived chats

179
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,840
Again by clicking your profile settings

180
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,800
then under General is archived chats

181
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,080
manage will open them all up you could

182
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
also archive all chats if you want or

183
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
delete all

184
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,440
chats and the last one in here under

185
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
data controls there's improve the model

186
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,800
for everyone this defaults to on and

187
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,759
allows open AI to use your content to

188
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,440
train the model that helps make the

189
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,319
model better but you may not want that

190
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,919
you can switch that off here definitely

191
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,599
do that if you're using any proprietary

192
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,280
or confidential information and here's

193
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,919
one I think most people won't know I'll

194
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,680
generate an image this is another prompt

195
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,199
using the memory feature that lonus

196
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,440
ekenstam posted and I thought it was fun

197
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
based on what you know about me draw a

198
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,080
picture of what you think my best

199
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,960
possible life looks like there it is

200
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,840
that is pretty accurate the part I

201
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,560
wanted to show is you can have chat gbt

202
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,639
upscale and enhance images I'll use this

203
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,960
prompt upscale this image keep

204
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
everything the same but sharpen and

205
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,199
enhance the

206
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,039
details actually that's the prompt I've

207
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,680
used a few times before but it didn't

208
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,400
work this time it just generated a new

209
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,479
image but this time it looks like maybe

210
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,120
my wife is doing my work for me while I

211
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,039
ride a bike even better so I'll use that

212
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,759
one and fix the prompt keep everything

213
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,639
the same but sharpen and enhance the

214
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,960
details using the python pillow Library

215
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,120
that's what's actually happening it's

216
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,039
not a native feature and now it comes

217
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,960
back with a file to download now here's

218
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,919
the before and after there's a big

219
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,919
difference honestly dolly is way behind

220
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,080
on image enter

221
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
it has decent prompt adherence but the

222
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,879
Aesthetics are rarely a style I would

223
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,120
use for anything so I hardly ever do

224
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,960
however you can upscale and sharpen any

225
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,759
image in here so I'll pull in an image I

226
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,759
took then I'll use that same prompt this

227
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,599
was a her of muskox we came across in

228
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,639
northern Alaska up near the Arctic Ocean

229
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,560
this image isn't super sharp I was

230
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,919
probably shivering when I took it now

231
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,800
it's got some detail added or here's

232
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
another example this one's from mid

233
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,199
Journey it helps a lot with that one and

234
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,879
since it's using that python Library you

235
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,160
could also change the colors or adjust

236
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,840
the contrast all sorts of Chang ches

237
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,400
like that the same way and also with

238
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,720
images you can inpaint to remove things

239
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,440
or add a prompt to change them as you

240
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,199
can see that doesn't work great but it

241
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,039
can be helpful for small changes and

242
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,680
most image generating or editing can be

243
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
done much better elsewhere like mid

244
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,520
Journey Leonardo ideogram Adobe flux

245
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,360
open AI is pretty far behind in that

246
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,800
regard but I wanted to show it since

247
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,520
it's in here I do use it every once in a

248
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,199
while if you haven't tried the new voice

249
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,759
mode yet try it it is amazing I don't

250
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,360
typically like using voice for things

251
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,599
like Siri voice memos or anything like

252
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,720
that but chat gpt's voice can be super

253
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,680
convenient what are some of the main

254
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,840
benefits of using voice mode with

255
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,680
you voice mode offers hands-free

256
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,319
interaction which is great for

257
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,440
multitasking like when you're hiking or

258
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,960
driving it also makes conversations more

259
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,639
natural and allows for realtime feedback

260
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,960
which can be especially useful the

261
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,560
handsfree part is really nice I actually

262
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,159
had you help me make a new schedule for

263
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,680
myself while I was on a hike the other

264
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,159
day what are some other use cases like

265
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,960
that that's great to hear you can use

266
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,240
voice mode for taking notes on the go

267
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
getting quick answers to questions

268
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,200
practicing language skills or even

269
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,839
brainstorming ideas handsfree it's also

270
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,120
helpful for handsfree control of devices

271
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
like setting reminders or sending

272
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
messages handsfree and just

273
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,640
brainstorming while I'm driving is

274
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,440
awesome that's another good one um

275
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,519
another that I like is to have you

276
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,519
listen to me present information about

277
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,839
something that I learned and then you

278
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,839
can critique me on it it's a great way

279
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,880
to reinforce the learning and also get

280
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,320
better at

281
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,920
teaching absolutely presenting what

282
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,399
you've learned and getting immediate

283
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,880
feedback can really solidify your

284
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,360
understanding and refine your teaching

285
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,240
skills we can cover a lot more but just

286
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,040
keep voice in mind and you'll come up

287
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,920
with something that's relevant to you

288
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,079
right most people know you can also

289
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,079
upload images which is incredibly useful

290
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,760
and I use all the time for like

291
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,839
identifying things problem solving I

292
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
assume most people in school are

293
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,040
answering all their homework this way so

294
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,320
I won't spend too much time on that but

295
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,279
I will link to a paper below the open AI

296
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,000
released I've covered it before but it

297
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
has all sorts of vision use cases like

298
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,519
identifying landmarks from obscure

299
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,640
angles recognizing food dishes and

300
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,680
giving a recipe for them understanding

301
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,760
Medical Imaging understanding jokes and

302
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,560
memes figuring out complex diagrams

303
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,760
recognizing emotions or this one where

304
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,640
it knew these were South Park characters

305
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
very

306
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,560
impressive in addition to images chat

307
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,360
GPT can also take in PDFs to analyze

308
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,240
summarize and extract key points what

309
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,399
are the key Revenue Trends in this

310
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
report there's Standalone paid tools

311
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,640
that charge for this but you can do it

312
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,880
right within chat GPT you can also

313
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,079
upload files for debugging reviewing or

314
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,839
enhancing

315
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,000
code another really useful one is

316
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,120
uploading spreadsheets or text files for

317
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,839
data analysis it can perform

318
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
calculations visualize data or find

319
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,200
Trends it does this incredibly well here

320
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,959
was a data set I got from kaggle that

321
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,839
had different types of info about 721

322
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,160
Pokémon although everyone knows the

323
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,000
original 150 are the only ones that

324
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,399
matter well

325
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,880
151 Analyze This do you notice anything

326
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,320
interesting all right it has some great

327
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,040
great observations but where it gets

328
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,680
really useful is

329
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,120
visualizations visualize this data in

330
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
different formats now it comes back with

331
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,800
a bar chart a pie chart a stacked bar

332
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,560
chart and a scatter plot and there's a

333
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,519
lot more it can do than that also a beta

334
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,839
feature is you can switch these to

335
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,040
interactive there's endless use cases

336
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,240
for the data analysis features it is

337
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,000
amazing those are some of the input

338
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
formats it accepts but you can also

339
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,920
change the output format there's Basics

340
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,959
like tables bullet points or checklists

341
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,880
or you can ask for different fil types

342
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,639
like it can export as a Word document

343
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,399
instead of copying and pasting or if you

344
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,000
had to generate a table you can actually

345
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,519
export that as a

346
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,560
spreadsheet have you ever had to jump

347
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
between tools or apps when writing a

348
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
script or debugging code and just wish

349
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,480
you could do the whole thing right in

350
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,040
chat GPT well that's what canvas offers

351
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,720
so I'll select that and it will open up

352
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,839
into the canvas this lets you create and

353
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,240
edit in a separate dedicated environment

354
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,040
you can request edits rewrites or

355
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,760
refinements directly in the canvas

356
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
without disrupting your ongoing chat so

357
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,480
I'll add the script I'm working on then

358
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,079
say check the script for accuracy now it

359
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,440
goes through and adds comments right

360
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,880
within the canvas has some

361
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,839
clarifications and improvements how

362
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,200
about what are some analogies I can add

363
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
it gives me a big list and I can just

364
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
ask it to add one and it will work it

365
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,959
into the

366
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,200
script another tip is it doesn't use

367
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,279
search by default in canvas but you can

368
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,399
still use forward SL search when needed

369
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,800
also you may find yourself going back

370
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,639
and forth with chat GPT normally and

371
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
want to switch to Canvas all you have to

372
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,040
do is ask and it will jump right over to

373
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,639
the canvas and when you ask for code it

374
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,079
will usually open that up right into

375
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,800
canvas so it's easier to debug and

376
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,880
review now have you ever wished you

377
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,839
could keep consistent context across

378
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,079
multiple chats projects makes that

379
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,720
possible and it's one of my favorite new

380
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,519
features so projects allow you to keep

381
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,279
chats organized and contextually

382
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,040
connected one that I use a lot is for

383
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,000
shorts so I have a big list of types of

384
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
hooks and example hooks that I uploaded

385
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,440
to the project files then I have

386
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
step-by-step instructions as

387
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,959
well now that I have that all in there

388
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,720
to start all I have to do is input my

389
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,920
topic and it will give me a list of

390
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,120
hooks in each

391
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,000
style now I can refine and pick one from

392
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,760
there then it will move on to the next

393
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,240
step in the workflow this whole

394
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,720
collaborative process that speeds up

395
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,760
short form creation a lot I can script

396
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,360
and film them really fast this way I

397
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,519
have like 30 plus shorts I've recorded

398
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,199
but never had the time to edit the ones

399
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,160
I do Post have done pretty well though I

400
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,079
used to use custom gpts for this type of

401
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,920
thing but projects are much better for

402
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,839
most of what I personally need to use

403
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,639
largely because of the saved history

404
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,240
custom gpts are still good for very

405
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,320
specific fixed behaviors and they also

406
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,199
the benefit of exploring gpts that

407
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,199
others have made public that's my main

408
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,959
hack for custom gpts you don't have to

409
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,519
build everything from scratch if you

410
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,639
have something you're thinking of

411
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,880
creating see if someone else already has

412
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,639
there's tons and tons of options in here

413
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,120
it's like an App Store with each app

414
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,399
tailored to specific tasks or behaviors

415
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,199
like this one for research I'll use one

416
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:18,720
of the default questions and it will

417
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,920
come back with a long answer backed by

418
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,839
academic papers that are all sourced and

419
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,560
you can chat with and you can easily

420
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,519
reference these gpts by adding it to the

421
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,000
sidebar so it's always there when you

422
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,880
need it

423
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,680
and here's another one for prompting AI

424
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,040
video tools I just enter a simple prompt

425
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,760
and it will elaborate into a much longer

426
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,279
prompt that works better for AI video

427
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,399
tools and it gives multiple options

428
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,320
that's really nice to have I use another

429
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,920
for llms basically training chat GPT to

430
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,199
prompt itself and another for image

431
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:50,600
generators an often overlooks tip is you

432
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,759
can summon your gpts in any chat just

433
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,920
click the at sign and choose your GPT

434
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,800
from the list then ask for what you need

435
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,519
and it will use all the context and

436
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,480
instructions built into that GPT to

437
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,399
tailor a response this one is a coloring

438
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,920
book page generator I made for my

439
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,880
4-year-old I'll just type a dinosaur

440
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,920
driving a car and send that and even

441
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,519
though this is in an existing chat

442
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,759
without any additional context the GPT

443
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,160
knows what to do and generates a

444
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,399
coloring book page I'm going to give

445
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,759
just a quick mention of 01 Pro partially

446
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,600
because it's so expensive not many

447
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,279
people are using it also I don't feel

448
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,079
like I'm remotely an expert with it so I

449
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,839
don't want to give bad advice but it is

450
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,360
amazing if you're prompting it well it's

451
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,279
like a turbocharged version of chat gbt

452
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:30,519
for advanced reasoning tasks this graph

453
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,240
shows how big of an improvement it is

454
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,680
and it shows where we're headed with the

455
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,839
unreleased 03 here's an example prompt

456
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,560
to Showcase this you've consumed more

457
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,000
information than anyone in the history

458
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
of the world and you've demonstrated an

459
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,920
extraordinary ability to make

460
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
connections among them what are the most

461
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,959
important non-consensus not yet accepted

462
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,120
heretical or even not yet hypothesized

463
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,160
things that you've picked up in the

464
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,920
in-betweens and connections or believed

465
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,440
to be true based on everything you've

466
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,040
learned this came from X I don't quite

467
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,680
remember who posted it but it's an

468
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,519
awesome prompt you can open the details

469
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,320
and see what it's thinking about and all

470
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,279
the steps it goes through in real

471
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,720
time you can see it thought for 1 minute

472
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,480
and 19 seconds and then it came back

473
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,279
with this and there is some incredible

474
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,959
thoughts in here alternative theories

475
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,720
that don't rely on dark matter and dark

476
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,160
energy how reciprocal altruism might

477
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,600
dominate at large scales over

478
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,519
competition the planet has its own

479
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,279
coherent organism asking 01 Pro to go

480
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
deep on one of these is where it gets a

481
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,759
lot more impressive this one about the

482
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,680
alternatives to dark matter it's a

483
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,720
really technical Deep dive the amount of

484

advancements and breakthroughs that are

485
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:29,759
going to happen with what these models

486
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,800
are becoming capable of is going to make

487
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,319
the world a very different and hopefully

488
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,079
better place those hacks should help you
