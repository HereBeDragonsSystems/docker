1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,480
new AI tools come out every day I test a

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,440
lot of them but very few make the cut

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,520
into my permanent stack the ones that do

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,559
tend to be tools that save the most time

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,200
saving 3 hours a day saves you over a,

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,440
hours per year and for a lot of people

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,320
AI is already able to do that an

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,320
exercise I recommend everyone do is over

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,039
the course of like a week write down all

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,199
your most timeconsuming tasks then set

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,359
aside a day to find the best AI workflow

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,680
to assist or even fully automate those

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,240
tasks many people will find that they're

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,199
able to save multiple hours a day I'll

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,960
go through a big list of tools across

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,840
different use cases to help us that so a

17
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,960
lot will apply to you some won't let's

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,320
get into

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,600
it Google felt like they were behind in

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
AI for a while but have been dropping

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,640
some amazing stuff recently A lot of it

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,520
is completely free I'll cover a couple

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
of the biggest Time Savers for me I'll

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,920
start with Google AI Studios realtime AI

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,600
assistant it can be used for a lot of

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,480
things it's awesome in particular for

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,600
learning new software this is at aist

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,199
studio. google.com there's a lot of

29

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,360
for the ultra key effect click the

64
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,440
eyedropper icon next to the key color

65
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,920
option and then click on the blue

66
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,200
background in the program

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,560
still got it it looks like it's a bit

70
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,599
hazy

71
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,400
you can adjust the mat generation

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,120
settings in the ultra key effect to

73
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,959
refine the key do you want me to help

74
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,440
you with

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,280
that I just like drag them around looks

76
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,879
like transparency is doing something um

77
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,400
what should I do

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
here okay it looks like the transparency

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,239
setting is affecting the haze try

80
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,080
adjusting the transparency highlight and

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,440
Shadow sliders to refine the edges of

82
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,720
the key do you want to keep

83
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,560
experimenting with the sliders yourself

84
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,080
or would you like some specific guidance

85
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,560
on how to adjust them they're looking

86
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,879
all right is there any other settings I

87
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,599
should do all right you can also try

88
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,319
adjusting the matte cleanup settings

89
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,360
like choke and soften to further refine

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,400
the edges would you like me to explain

91
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,319
what those

92
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,000
do no I think I've got it looking pretty

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,799
good here so now can I have you teach me

94
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,040
how to clean up and enhance my audio

95
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,760
sure I can help with that in premere Pro

96
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,560
you can use the essential sound panel to

97
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,319
clean up you get the idea that's

98
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,439
incredible it answers almost instantly

99
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,439
and you can interrupt and clarify when

100
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,560
needed an expert real-time tutor to help

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
you learn anything has been one of the

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,599
dreams in AI it is not all the way there

103
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,840
yet it will still make plenty of

104
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
mistakes but it will be right and save

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,439
time quite a bit and YouTube won't

106
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,319
always have like the specific scenario

107
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,879
you need or sometimes you don't even

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,040
know what you need to look up to achieve

109
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,640
something and on your phone you can do

110
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
the same thing but using the camera

111
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,000
maybe you have some homework you need a

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,040
tutor for and are totally not just

113
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,319
cheating you could have it walk you

114
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,959
through a science experiment help you

115
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,959
set up Furniture understand documents

116
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,400
all sorts of stuff it's like the vision

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
feature in chat GPT but real time

118
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,360
instead of uploading photos another one

119
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,959
from them is Google Gemini deep research

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,720
it's an agentic model that will take

121
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,599
multiple steps to deeply research a

122
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,319
topic here's an example I actually just

123
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,599
got a PRP injection in my shoulder a few

124
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,040
days ago I did a ton of research into it

125
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,839
beforehand but here's how I could have

126
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,720
done that in here so I'll make sure deep

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,240
research is selected from the dropdown

128
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,600
then add a prompt provide a detailed

129
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,960
summary of platelet rich plasma

130
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,440
injections for shoulder related

131
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,080
conditions with a focus on tendonopathy

132
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
include potential risks and current

133
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
clinical evidence highlight any recent

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,960
advancements or controversies specific

135
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,840
to shoulder treatments also compare the

136
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
outcomes of PRP injections with

137
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
corticosteroid treatments for

138
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,680
musculoskeletal conditions so I'll send

139
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,080
that it thinks for a second then it

140
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,919
shows me its plan it has eight steps it

141
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,960
will walk through I can edit that if I'd

142
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,720
like to but I'll start it as

143
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,000
is now it starts its research it's

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
researching 27 websites that seems like

145
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,880
a lot but it's actually on the low end

146
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,320
for what it usually uses this will be

147
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,160
over a 100 websites a lot of the time I

148
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,120
chose a pretty simple example it's got

149
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,919
some PubMed what looks like some

150
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,560
different clinics a bunch of other

151
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,440
journals looks like a solid list I'll

152
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,800
come back when it's done all right that

153
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,520
took around 3 minutes and here's what it

154
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,319
came back with this is an incredibly

155
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,919
comprehensive report based on these

156
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,639
findings with what it is how it works

157
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,880
side effects treatment protocols got

158
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,160
risks Effectiveness comparisons there's

159
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,919
a lot in here which basically confirms

160
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,639
the reasons why I got the treatment

161
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,120
already but deep research is well named

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
and I was able to tailor it specific to

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,360
my situation with my shoulder rather

164
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,440
than all PRP uses this isn't for just

165
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,880
random oneoff questions that you might

166
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,199
pop into chat GPT or Google but it is

167
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,400
incredible for deep research and the use

168
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,080
cases are endless and this is part of

169
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,199
Gemini Advanced which comes with a lot

170
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,440
of other features but does cost $20 a

171
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,400
month after a one-month free trial there

172
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,280
are of course and this ways to use chat

173
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,720
GPT to save time so in the description

174
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,120
will be a free chat GPT resource bundle

175
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,039
provided by HubSpot there's a total of

176
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,080
five PDFs that go in-depth on how you

177
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,280
can utilize Chachi PT in your career and

178
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,560
it was just updated for 2025 there's one

179
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,240
that walks through a process similar to

180
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
how I mentioned to find your most

181
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,280
time-consuming tasks AI can help with

182
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,919
but it's a much deeper and more

183
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,599
step-by-step guide to do that but my

184
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,960
favorite in here is called supercharge

185
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
your workday with chat GPT it covers

186
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
specific examples of how chat GPT can be

187
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,919
used in various Industries sales and

188
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,800
marketing customer support time

189
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,479
management and task organization

190
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,199
personal development and learning it

191
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,120
walks through stepbystep with different

192
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,720
tips and I really like the section

193
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,280
titled 100 ways to try chachy PT today

194
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,160
it has 100 sample prompts you can use

195
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
and modify no matter what career you

196
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,599
have there sure to be a bunch in there

197
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,479
that apply and keeping in line with this

198
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,280
video prompts templates like that are

199
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
another way to save a ton of time again

200
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,919
that resource is completely free just

201
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,360
use the link in the description to go

202
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,039
download that I'm always happy to

203
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,720
partner with HubSpot to provide free

204
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,240
resources to the people that watch this

205
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,039
channel but back on the free end from

206
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,120
Google is notebook LM which I've covered

207
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,800
extensively before but they have some

208
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
new features since then it's another

209
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,280
personalized AI powered research

210
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,080
assistant deep seek R1 came out the

211
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
other day and blew everyone away so I

212
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,400
uploaded a PDF of the research paper a

213
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,280
link to the GitHub and a couple websites

214
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,000
about it in here you can also upload

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,319
YouTube videos or I'll even use PDFs of

216
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,400
an entire book I'm reading sometimes it

217
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
can take in a lot of information now I

218
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
can have it summarize all the

219
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,160
information or even more helpful is I

220
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,039
can ask a question then it will give me

221
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,000
an answer and site exactly where that

222
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
information came from in my uploads

223
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
I can also create a study guide that

224
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
will give me a quiz with an answer key

225
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,400
essay questions and a glossery of key

226
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,680
terms I could also create a briefing doc

227
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,479
FAQs timeline or the most unique option

228
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,280
is the podcast feature you can add

229
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,840
prompts to customize and guide what they

230
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,919
talk about if you'd like then this will

231
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,039
generate a full podcast all about the

232
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,879
topic with the new interactive mode you

233
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,879
can also jump into the podcast and ask a

234
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,960
question they'll answer that or you can

235
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,680
steer the conversation in any direction

236
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,120
you want yeah I'm excited to dive in and

237
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,639
what's really interesting is how their

238
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,800
achieving this reasoning in AI it's

239
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
quite a departure from how things are

240
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,159
normally done yeah usually we think

241
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,520
about AI being trained on you know these

242
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,560
massive data sets like feeding it you

243
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
know the entire Library of Congress or

244
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,039
something and that's how it learns but

245
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,000
that can be really expensive and time

246
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,720
consuming and what happens when it

247
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,360
encounters something outside of that

248
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,599
data set you know something totally new

249
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,240
it's not going to be able to adapt very

250
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,400
well exactly and that's one of the

251
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
limitations that deep seeks team has

252
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,520
been really focused on addressing

253
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,280
they've created this model called Deep

254
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,320
seek

255
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,159
r10 and the Really fascinating thing is

256
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,559
it was trained using only reinforcement

257
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,640
learning No Label data at all whoa did

258
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,440
someone just break the fourth wall let's

259
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,519
hear it and they open sourced the whole

260
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,040
thing right can you speak about that for

261
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,959
a minute absolutely and it's a really

262
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,920
key part of what makes deep seek stand

263
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,800
out yeah it's not just the technology

264
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,120
itself but the way they're sharing it

265
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,720
with everyone the fact that they've made

266
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,160
their models and research open source is

267
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,079
a big deal it really sets the apart it's

268
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,200
kind of like they're saying here's what

269
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,880
we've done now let's all build on it

270
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,519
together those are the best options from

271
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,160
Google that I wanted to cover now I'll

272
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,640
jump through some other tools a lot

273
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,320
faster they're across different use

274
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,800
cases so some may or may not be related

275
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,079
to what you

276
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,880
need with gamma just write a text prompt

277
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,959
and it will generate an entire beautiful

278
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,040
presentation with engaging text and

279
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,680
relevant images there are other tools

280
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,040
that do this but gamma has been my

281
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,600
favorite one you can also create

282
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,560
documents and websites with gamma but

283
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,359
I've primarily used it for presentation

284
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,560
now if you need a coding assistant

285
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,680
cursor is the leading tool right now you

286
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,640
can build and deploy fully functioning

287
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,279
apps without any coding knowledge it's

288
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,200
all just from prompting then you go back

289
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,000
and forth for any changes you need I

290
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,399
don't have time to go into that much

291
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,959
here and I'm definitely not an expert at

292
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,040
this anyways um Riley Brown has a bunch

293
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,720
of videos on building cool stuff with it

294
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,880
there's lots of channels with deeper

295
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,480
dives into cursor to go check out

296
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,720
complimentary to that is Wizard which is

297
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,360
ideal for creating UI mockups wire

298
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
frames and Designs quickly using AI you

299
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,560
can generate from text turn a screenshot

300
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,320
into an editable mockup or a handdrawn

301
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,160
sketch into a digital design then

302
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
through prompting you can iterate

303
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
quickly add or modify components and for

304
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
a powerful combination you can export

305
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,920
the code Snippets and pass them into

306
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
cursor so wizard can create the entire

307
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,120
visual design quickly then cursor can

308
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,959
handle the backend logic and fine-tune

309
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,000
it all you can do this All without any

310
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,200
deep technical skills the ability to

311
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,839
easily build out apps that you can

312
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,839
customize exactly to your like is

313
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,279
incredible whether that's like a

314
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,320
personalized app just for your own use

315
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,560
or to build for deploying publicly the

316
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,680
entire SAS world is changing rapidly

317
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,959
with all these new

318
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,399
tools napkin AI is amazing for creating

319
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,440
graphics and visuals from text they just

320
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
came out with a big update that's faster

321
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
and has a lot more designs it's super

322
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,320
easy to use and is still completely free

323
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,000
as of the filming of this video I'll do

324
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,560
an example I used before so I can see

325
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,279
how the new update Compares you can

326
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,000
upload your own information or I'll use

327
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
AI to help with this one five things

328
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,320
most likely to cause the AI Apocalypse

329
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,600
in order of

330
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,560
likelihood all right there's a solid

331
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,639
list I'll start with just the first one

332
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,079
I'll click the lightning button and

333
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,839
here's a bunch of visuals I can cycle

334
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,959
through a lot of these look awesome then

335
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,320
if you find one you like there's

336
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,480
additional styles for each so there's

337
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,279
tons and tons to choose from and the

338
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,959
colors are all fully customizable as

339
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,839
well I could also highlight all the text

340
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,760
and do it for all five I'll give that a

341
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,000
try and now there's a bunch more really

342
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,320
solid

343
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,279
visuals and I think these are awesome to

344
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,399
use in videos I can download one then

345
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,279
blur out parts and add some zooms and

346
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,120
now it's an amazing looking really

347
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,959
engaging graphic that I made in just a

348
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:50,200
few

349
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,720
seconds using an AI meeting assistant

350
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,600
can be a huge timesaver there's a lot of

351
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,399
options out there I've tested a few my

352
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
favorite was otter especially if you're

353
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,880
looking for something you user friendly

354
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
with a shorter learning curve on the

355
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
more advanced side with a lot more

356
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
features and advanced functionalities I

357
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,959
liked fireflies but these all work

358
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,920
similarly integrating into Zoom Google

359
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,839
meet and Microsoft teams it will

360
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,519
transcribe your full meeting then give

361
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,440
you a summary then you can search the

362
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,199
text to play back the audio at

363
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,360
adjustable speeds then tap the words to

364
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,440
jump to different spots it can highlight

365
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,240
key points to review later it has

366
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
automated slide capture it will insert

367
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
into the notes it's super helpful if you

368
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,880
have a lot of meetings to be able to

369
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,920
review them but also to be able to stay

370
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,720
focused and attentive during the meeting

371
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,160
and there's further use cases depending

372
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,920
on what you do like if you or your team

373
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,240
do a lot of sales calls you could ask to

374
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,040
identify weak points in the process or

375
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,920
to find common objections if you need

376
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,839
more advanced uses like that I'd

377
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,839
recommend fireflies this next one is a

378
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,760
big one if you have a YouTube channel I

379
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,240
have a flux Laura trained on my face and

380
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,320
anytime I want an image of myself in any

381
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,240
setting or pose I can just prompt for it

382
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,839
I use this on replicate and I've taught

383
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,399
this multiple times on this channel so

384
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,360
I'll link to a longer video if you need

385
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,160
it but it's really easy to do basically

386
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,920
you just need at least 10 images of

387
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,279
yourself from different angles and

388
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,800
expressions you upload those then name

389
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,000
it and select a few drop downs it costs

390
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
around $5 to train which you only need

391
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,839
to do once then it's just a few cents

392
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,399
after that anytime you need to generate

393
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,800
an image you can easily make amazing

394
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,440
unique thumbnails without setting up

395
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,560
your camera and lighting every time it's

396
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
awesome another research assistant that

397
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,160
probably everyone watching this channel

398
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,320
Knows by now is perplexity I mainly use

399
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,240
perplexity because of its speed at

400
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,120
finding things like stats research or

401
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,800
quotes I may need for a video although I

402
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,240
don't have the Pro Plan anymore all I

403
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,639
need is the free and I have actually

404
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,680
started to move back to chat PT for a

405
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
lot of this since their native search

406
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,639
feature has gotten so much better but

407
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,959
now displays images and sources it does

408
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,399
a lot of what perplexity has been really

409
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,120
good at I debated on still including it

410
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,000
in this video but for some use cases you

411
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,079
may find it to be the best tool and they

412
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,639
are starting to implement actions with

413
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,600
perplexity assistant you can ask it to

414
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,800
play a specific song it can help book a

415
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,600
restaurant you can search with vision

416
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
which is a nice upgrade chat GPT came

417
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,480
out with operators as well over all

418
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,199
agents like this even though there's a

419
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,800
lot of hype around them they're not

420
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,480
there yet for anything practical I do

421
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,120
think it's a good idea to mess around

422
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,240
with them to get a feel for how AI

423
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,079
interacts with websites on its own just

424
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,120
for learning sake and to stay ahead of

425
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,759
the curve one day we may have a

426
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,839
dashboard of Agents we're overseeing

427
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,480
just kind of watching for mistakes and

428
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,279
places to intervene and nudge but I

429
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,920
think we're a ways out from that but

430
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,639
sticking with llms these are the type of

431
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,440
AI tool people are generally the most

432
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,519
familiar with but it's also one of the

433
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,399
biggest Time Savers for me personally

434
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,040
and I assume could be for most people

435
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,440
too this is an area where like I

436
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,759
mentioned at the beginning if you write

437
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,839
down your most timeconsuming tasks there

438
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,519
is very often a way that AI can automate

439
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,680
or assist with those tasks and llms are

440
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,519
the most common solution the top two I

441
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,959
use are Claude and chat GPT Claude is my

442
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,560
go-to writing assistant although chat

443
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,160
GPT has definitely gotten better at

444
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,440
creative writing but I don't think it's

445
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,680
as good as Claud yet there's other

446
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,680
writing tools like Jasper Lex WR Sonic

447
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,839
copy and tons of others if there's a

448
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,800
specific type of writing you do a lot

449
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,360
you may want to find one that's tailored

450
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,079
for that they typically all use CLA or

451
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,720
chaty PT under the hood but they just

452
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,759
have solid prompt engineering and a nice

453
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,600
UI on top of it for me I just do my own

454
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
prompting and have never felt the need

455
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,839
for a specialized writing tool typically

456
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,440
I just get outlines and do the bulk of

457
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,920
the actual tone and writing myself

458
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,680
anyways with chat GPT using custom gpts

459
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,959
or projects to streamline a repetitive

460
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,920
task is something just about everyone

461
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,680
will be able to do the projects allow

462
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,399
you to keep chats organized and

463
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
contextually connected it's great for

464
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,560
long-term multi-step workflows here's a

465
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
pretty easy one that I use for shorts so

466
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,880
I have a big list of types of hooks and

467
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,440
example hooks that I uploaded to the

468
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,360
project files then I have step-by-step

469
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,319
instructions as well to start all I have

470
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,199
to do is input my topic and it will give

471
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,240
me a list of hooks in each style so I

472
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,920
can refine and pick one from there then

473
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,680
it will move on to the next step of the

474
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,600
workflow it's a whole collaborative

475
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,120
process that speeds up short form

476
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,839
creation a lot I do also have this set

477
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,680
up in cloud this isn't particularly

478
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,560
creative writing so both work really

479
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,600
well custom gpts are great for very

480
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,639
specific fixed behaviors and they also

481
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,519
have the benefit of exploring gpts

482
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,959
others have made public if you have

483
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,360
something you're thinking of creating

484
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,959
see if someone else already has there's

485
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,759
tons of options in here one example I

486
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,959
use that I really like is I have gpts

487
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,839
for crafting prompts that's a huge

488
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:11,040
timesaver this one's for videos I just

489
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,560
enter a simple prompt and it will

490
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,519
elaborate into a much longer prompt that

491
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,600
works better for AI video tools and it

492
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,519
gives multiple options that's really

493
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,240
nice to have I have another one for llms

494
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,319
basically training chat GPT to prompt

495
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,240
itself and another for text to image

496
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,319
prompts and an often overlooked feature

497
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,600
is you can summon your gpts in any chat

498
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,319
just click the at sign and choose your

499
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,560
GPT from the list then ask for what you

500
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,399
need then it will use all the context

501
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,920
and instructions you've built into that

502
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,000
GPT to tailor a response so this is a

503
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,680
coloring book page generator I made for

504
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,639
my four-year-old and I'll send that and

505
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,480
even though this is in an existing chat

506
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
without any additional context it knows

507
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,040
what to do and generates me a coloring

508
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,279
book page again I do recommend you

509
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,759
actually create a list of your most

510
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,399
timec consuming tasks and try to find

511
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,040
ways AI can help hopefully this video

512
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
will give you some ideas and this huge

513
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,519
list of tools will be a good place to

514
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,360
start I've got a huge update from

515
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,560
futurepedia we partnered with skill leap

516
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,319
AI so we looked around and they had

517
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,319
built the best AI learning platform I

518
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,280
could find so we partnered with them and

519
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,000
have now built that platform into

520
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,400
futurepedia there's over 20 amazing

521
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,280
extremely in-depth courses covering all

522
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,959
different aspects of AI and how to use

523
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,599
it in your own life and business it's

524
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,079
the perfect place to learn a lot of the

525
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,000
stuff I talked about in this video it is

526
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,439
also where I will be launching all of

527
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,280
the courses I'm working on right now

528
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,559
I'll have a link down in the description

529
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,919
where you can go to try that out for

530
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,960
free and thank you so much for watching

531
