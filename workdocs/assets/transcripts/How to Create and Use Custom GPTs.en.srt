1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,360
that brings us to the biggest update

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,279
custom gpts to get to them just click

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,000
explore gpts on the sidebar near the top

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,120
a lot of these that are built by

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,240
companies are honestly just a less

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,360
userfriendly way to use their product

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,719
but the fact that you can call them

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,760
within chats and stack functionalities

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,160
across a bunch of different tools now

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,880
starts to become really powerful I'll

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,279
show you some examples of that near the

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,599
end this is one step closer to agents

13
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,640
but overall there is a ton to sift

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,039
through in here I want to quickly show

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,119
just a really useful and easy to use one

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,720
this can create cool diagrams with

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
flowcharts and mind maps so I'll find it

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920
using the search bar for Whimsical

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,079
diagrams then it starts a new chat with

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,760
it you can type in here or what will

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,559
tend to be more common with one like

22
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,760
this if you're in the middle of a chat

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,399
like this one about how llms are trained

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,280
I want help visualizing that so I'll use

25
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,800
the at symbol and select it then I'll

26
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,520
say show me that as a mind map and it

27
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,280
will ask me to

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
approve then pretty quickly it has this

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,559
awesome mind map created then there's a

30
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,879
link that will take you to the site

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,239
where you can edit it further if you'd

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,920
like this is a really cool one and once

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,799
you start experimenting and just finding

34
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,080
different gpts that apply to you just

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,960
opens up a whole world of possibilities

36
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,439
and as a side note if you're actually

37
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,439
interested in how llms are trained and

38
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,880
how they work on carpath video is by far

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,720
the best intro to that topic I've come

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
across sorry for the pronunciation

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
there's a lot of cool gpts already built

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,119
but let's build one of our own I'll

43
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,439
start off really simple so I have a

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
3-year-old and he loves to color and for

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,720
a while I've been using mid journey to

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,360
create coloring book pages for him I

47
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,000
have a few prompts saved and just switch

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,200
a couple words around and let it

49
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,159
generate that does work well but with a

50
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,520
custom GPT I can make it even easier

51
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,560
I'll do this conversationally at first

52
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,280
before showing how to customize these

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,479
and build them from

54
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,399
scratch I just click create up

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,360
here an image generator that only

56
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,680
generates coloring book pages for

57
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,079
children it has the preview on the other

58
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,600
side as we build just from that it would

59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,479
actually probably be usable already

60
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,119
under configure it's already filled in

61
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,960
these fields it also suggested a title I

62
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,080
want something a little more

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,038
imaginative that's

64
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,400
good now it's generating a profile

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,680
picture and that's perfect and now it's

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,800
asking about the interaction style so I

67
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,040
went through a couple back and forths

68
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,680
here it was all easy stuff so I wanted

69
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,000
to speed it up basically I was just

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
telling it to keep everything simple and

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160
kid-friendly then asked it to act like a

72
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
creative friend now we can test it out I

73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
want to make sure it works with as

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
little input as possible so I'll just

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,480
write a

76
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,599
dinosaur that's a really solid dinosaur

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,760
and it has a fun description the Emojis

78
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
are a nice touch but I want it to be

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,518
simpler since my son is only

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,599
three all right now it's updated so I'll

81
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,840
give it another

82
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,200
try all right that's great I want to try

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,680
one that's a little more complex and see

84
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,120
how it does a bear driving a race car

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,000
through a

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,040
forest all right that one ended up with

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,480
some color I thought it would have been

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,920
implied by calling it a coloring book

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
page but I'll ask it to make sure it

90
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,720
only generates in black and white all

91
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,920
right now I'll try again that is amazing

92
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,319
this is already done I could just click

93
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,840
save right now but let's look at the

94
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,480
configure tab to see what it did here so

95
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,400
it has the title and a brief description

96
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
that's what will show up to other users

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,640
if you make it public it has the

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,760
instruction for what it does these are

99
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,480
short because this one was pretty simple

100
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
but it guides how the imag will be

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,519
created with the constraints and how it

102
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,040
will interact in a fun way and for the

103
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,439
conversation starters I want to make

104
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,159
some changes here so they're more

105
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,760
interactive in case he doesn't have an

106
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,400
idea list some themes to choose from

107
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,280
some characters settings then surprise

108
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,159
me that should be fun and we didn't need

109
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,879
to upload anything to the knowledge base

110
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,159
but this is where you can upload

111
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,640
additional files for your GPT to use as

112
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,519
context things like a tutorial

113
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,720
transcripts or writing samples and the

114
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,439
only capability we really needed is

115
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,840
Dolly for image generation but it left

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,599
web browsing on generally it makes sense

117
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,879
to leave on any that you think it may

118
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,879
use doesn't really hurt then action is

119
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,360
where you could interact with other

120
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
applications through apis that's where

121
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,439
these can get really powerful but also

122
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,799
more complex you can go find existing

123
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,920
apis you can use or use one from your

124
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,839
business if you have one then convert it

125
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,440
into an open API schema to paste in here

126
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,199
that's beyond the scope of this video

127
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,800
there's also people that cover it better

128
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,520
than I would I don't have a development

129
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,600
background Liam Atley is one person I

130
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,240
saw cover that pretty in depth if you're

131
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,720
looking to build gpts to make money with

132
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,199
once they launch the monetization

133
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,080
features that will be the only way to

134
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,560
stand out otherwise someone can just

135
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,280
look at the functions of your GPT and

136
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,199
create it themselves I'm going to save

137
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,800
this one and just keep it for me you

138
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,520
could also make it accessible to anyone

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
with the link or fully public a very

140
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,000
important note is if you are building

141
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,759
one of these to make public all the

142
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,039
information made available to the GPT

143
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,560
that includes the prompt the

144
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,440
instructions and attached files it can

145
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,320
be used by the model to construct a

146
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,120
response to the user so just don't

147
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
include any information you don't want

148
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
the user to know there was also a hack

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
going around of a prompt you could use

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,080
to extract the full custom instructions

151
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,880
I just don't put any confidential info

152
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,280
into these um but here's the one I just

153
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,880
made want to test out these conversation

154
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,400
starters right that gave a great list of

155
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,759
characters to choose from I can almost

156
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,600
guarantee he would choose robot there it

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
is that's perfect and I want to test out

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,919
that surprise me

159
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,400
too all right that's great all I have to

160
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,960
do is open this up and just let him

161
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,319
click a button and it'll generate

162
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,680
another thing kind of cool here is on my

163
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,639
phone I'll be able to use voice and have

164
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,440
him just say what he wants into it then

165
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,160
it will make it for him and then also

166
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
say those fun descriptions out loud I

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,160
think this will be pretty fun this was

168
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
all created in just a few minutes from a

169
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,800
short conversation that anyone could

170
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,319
have had I know a lot of us have gotten

171
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,520
used to how far AI has come but when I

172
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,319
stop and think about this it's really

173
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,280
insane how easy that was if you

174
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,479
regularly use chat GPT for any specific

175
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,160
thing like coding writing brainstorming

176
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,639
or topics like Fitness Nutrition things

177
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,319
things like that if it needs information

178
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,440
about you or knowledge only you have you

179
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,319
can create a GPT then call it into any

180
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,000
chat instead of having to use a complex

181
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,639
prompt each time a common example would

182
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,120
be for writing instead of giving

183
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,800
examples using the F shot prompting

184
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,240
method from earlier you could upload

185
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,160
your examples into the knowledge base

186
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,240
and instructions of a GPT then anytime

187
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,960
you want to write something just call it

188
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,479
and it will write in your style then for

189
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,880
things that don't require your own

190
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,960
knowledge or resources there's probably

191
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,759
already one made that you can test out

192
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,080
there's hundreds of thousands of these

193
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,960
built already and again you can start

194
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,759
stacking the functionality on top of

195
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,479
each other I want to show a few examples

196
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,800
of people doing that this calling

197
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,520
feature just came out a few days ago so

198
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,639
I haven't started building out any

199
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,520
systems myself quite yet mainly because

200
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,479
I've been working on this video but

201
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,919
here's a few really cool ones I saw on

202
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,319
Twitter so this is Petro chirano

203
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,240
creating an app using grimoire which is

204
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,400
one of the most popular gpts it creates

205
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,440
all the code for a website about a

206
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,319
coffee shop in New York City specialized

207
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,400
in Italian coffee then he sends all that

208
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,720
code to designer GPT which will launch

209
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,520
and host the

210
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
site

211
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,680
and I'll skim through this one but zat

212
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,280
uses academic paper finder that finds

213
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,440
papers about smart contract auditing

214
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,599
then he uses ask your PDF research

215
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,280
assistant to download and explain a

216
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,000
couple of them then use his literature

217
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,720
review writer to write a literature

218
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,800
review using the contents of both papers

219
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,520
so then it writes a review and cites the

220
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,080
references you would of course want to

221
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,120
do more factchecking and due diligence

222
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,520
for something like this I'm just trying

223
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,879
to demo some of the functionality Ryan

224
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,440
Carson created a chief product officer

225
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,400
Chief Financial Officer and investor to

226
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,080
be able to call and interact with at any

227
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,680
time building gpts with different

228
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,560
knowledge sets about your business then

229
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,039
almost reading them like different

230
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,159
employees like a marketing specialist

231
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,879
sales associate customer service

232
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,759
representative designer things like that

233
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,159
and then just calling them anytime you

234
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,680
need them could be really helpful you

235
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,319
would of course want to be careful with

236
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,479
what information you're sharing with

237
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,879
chat GPT but it's a cool idea and Dan

238
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,360
shipper built this notion GPT that uses

239
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,639
zappier to connect directly to his

240
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,680
notion so he can save things from chat

241
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,879
GPT into his notion workspace instead of

242
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,440
having to copy and paste there's a ton

243
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,639
of different ways especially building

244
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,720
things into a tool like zapier that can

245
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,400
connect all of your different apps can

246
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,199
be really really powerful I'm sure

247
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
people will be coming up with a lot more

248
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,800
really cool stuff with this but more

249
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
importantly is to figure out ways that

250
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,360
you can apply it to your own career and

251
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,879
life
