1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,110
use case it has changed a lot over the past 
year the largest change being the launch of  

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,629
the website it's a gigantic improvement over 
Discord for usability Aesthetics inspiration  

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,510
just all around better everything so I've 
broken everything down with visualizations  

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,830
to help understand every parameter systems for 
prompting resources style reference explorers  

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,030
tons of examples some more unique workflows and 
lesser used techniques everything you need to  

6
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,830
master mid Journey as a complete beginner or a 
longtime user and once you get the hang of mid  

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:01:01,629
Journey it feels like magic [Music] let's Jump 
Right In here and get oriented with the site  

8
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,870
I'm not going to talk about anything in Discord 
this will be solely focused on the site because  

9
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:19,071
have generated with different ways to sort them 
it is the best spot for Endless inspiration using  

10
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:24,030
the search box you can search through by keyword 
to find things for inspiration or to use as style  

11
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:28,271
and image references when you click on an image 
it will show the full prompt and parameters they  

12
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:32,911
used click here to use the prompt or here to 
use it as a style or image reference you can  

13
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:38,791
also do that by dragging it up to the prompt bar 
and you can do that with multiple images to blend

14
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:49,390
them this mushroom has these little lights that 
made me think of a carousel so I ran with that as  

15
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:53,911
a style and image reference and came out with 
this we'll Deep dive into all of that later a  

16
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,471
really cool feature is when you hover over an 
image if you click the little magnifying glass  

17
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:02,631
it will pull up other similar images I make a 
habit of liking any images that I really like  

18
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:07,791
either the concept or style then I can sort 
by liked images and see them all you can find  

19
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:13,591
amazing inspiration this way to never run out of 
ideas as you can see I like a lot of weird stuff  

20
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:18,951
sometimes it's fun to just find the weirdest 
picture click the magnifying glass then find  

21
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:24,671
the weirdest picture out of those and repeat 
until you have nightmares or maybe that's just  

22
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:29,310
me in the Middle where it says imagine we 
have the prompt bar to generate just type  

23
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:35,231
in here and hit enter I'll start with a single 
word imagination send it a quick tip is you can  

24
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:39,751
hit the up Arrow to get your prompt back into the 
box this drop down on the right will open up the  

25
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:44,471
parameters I'll cover all of those in a second 
but they're easy to use just slide them around  

26
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:49,071
and then generate again this number popped up here 
that shows how many you currently have generated  

27
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:53,031
that's on the create tab which I can open 
and watch them generate and see the prompts  

28
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:57,831
and parameters on the side then this archive tab 
shows all your previous generations as thumbnails  

29
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:01,430
so it's easier to look through your history and 
to organize there's different ways to sort and  

30
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:06,911
view these to just images you've upscaled only 
landscape or portrait or older versions of mid  

31
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:10,511
Journey things like that you can change the 
layout to full so you see the entire images  

32
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:15,071
instead of just the square thumbnails or you can 
change the size and you can search through by date  

33
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:18,871
if you hover on the bar on the right so you don't 
have to scroll through thousands of images to go  

34
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:23,391
back I highly recommend getting into the habit 
of liking good Generations you make so you can  

35
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:28,310
find them easier later you can create folders by 
either manually selecting images hold down shift  

36
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:34,111
then click and drag to select or you can also 
create smart folders so say I want every logo  

37
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:38,551
I've made I just type the word logo then mid 
Journey instantly creates a folder with every  

38
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:45,470
time I've used the word logo in a prompt I'll also 
mention that down near the bottom you can switch  

39
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:50,311
between light and dark mode or just leave it on 
dark mode all the time like a normal person now  

40
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:55,391
next to create I can see it's finished averages 
around 30 seconds to complete so I'll click that  

41
00:03:55,391 --> 00:04:00,191
and these images look amazing and now I can go 
open up any of these generations and there's a  

42
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:05,751
whole list of options I can do with these from 
here vary upscale reframe repaint a lot of that  

43
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:10,551
is pretty intuitive how it works but we'll dive 
deeper into that as we go through these images are  

44
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:15,511
awesome these one-word prompts are really fun to 
see how mid Journey visualizes a concept you have  

45
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:49,010
no idea what's going to come out on the other side 
but it's fun I've done a bunch of these [Music]

46
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:49,591
[Music]

47
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:58,031
you can prompt with Emojis [Music] too so yeah 
type a Word get a cool image that's great but  

48
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:02,471
we want to have more control the main ways 
to control the output are through parameters  

49
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:07,631
prompting and references you can do all of that 
right up here it's incredible just how much as  

50
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:12,791
possible all within this little area clicking 
here will let you upload images for image style  

51
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:17,111
and character references or drag them here like I 
showed before the icon on the right gets me back  

52
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:21,591
to the parameters so in short parameters change 
the way mid Journey interprets your prompt that  

53
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:26,631
lets you explore and fine-tune an infinite amount 
of aesthetic directions I'll start with just the  

54
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:30,830
parameters that are here when you click this 
dropdown these are your main settings when you  

55
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:35,791
change one it will apply to every prompt going 
forward until you change it again under image  

56
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:40,151
size we've got portrait square and Landscape 
or you can drag the slider to adjust the aspect  

57
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:44,631
ratio they make it really easy there's tons of 
reasons for using any of these not only based  

58
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:49,470
on where you may be posting the images but it also 
influences the composition and feel of them if you  

59
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:53,791
want an aspect ratio that isn't here it doesn't 
look like it but you can actually type right in  

60
00:05:53,791 --> 00:06:00,111
here to replace the numbers with what you want now 
I've got one four in there maybe I need a bookmark  

61
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:06,950
giraffe on roller skates or it could flip that for 
a panorama of a concert hall or you can take that  

62
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:11,831
even more extreme if you want like this layout for 
an 8bit sidescroller adventure game you'll see it  

63
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:16,751
when I hit up to get the prompt back it shows the 
aspect ratio parameter at the end every parameter  

64
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:21,950
can be typed manually they will all start with 
a dash dash and they always go at the end of  

65
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,231
your prompt also anytime you do type a parameter 
manually it will override what you have in this  

66
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:30,471
drop down I have all of these parameters as well 
as all the others will cover in one cheat sheet  

67
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:34,391
that you can use as a reference that's down 
in the description along with a ton of other  

68
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:39,911
mid-journey resources there's also a free chat 
GPT resource bundle provided by HubSpot there's  

69
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:45,751
a total of five PDFs that go in-depth on how you 
can utilize chat GPT in your career to get ahead  

70
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:51,030
solve problems or save time my favorite is called 
how to supercharge your workday with chat GPT it  

71
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:56,111
covers specific examples of how chat GPT can be 
used in various Industries sales and marketing  

72
00:06:56,111 --> 00:07:01,431
project management enhanced decision-making and 
problem solving time management and organization  

73
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:07,151
it walks through step by step with different tips 
and even has a section titled 100 ways to try chat  

74
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:12,911
GPT today with 100 sample prompts you can use and 
modify no matter what career you have there's sure  

75
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:16,911
to be a bunch in there that apply and that's 
just one of the resources in the bundle which  

76
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:21,391
again is completely free just use the link in the 
description to go download that I have been happy  

77
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:25,511
to partner with HubSpot to provide free resources 
to the people that watch this channel moving on  

78
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:31,471
to Aesthetics we've got stylization weirdness and 
variety stylization adjusts how artistic the image  

79
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:36,471
is and by artistic that means favoring aesthetic 
colors composition and forms so here's a good one  

80
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:41,991
to demonstrate that a child's drawing of a cat the 
low stylization definitely looks more like a child  

81
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:46,991
drew it on the high end it favors an artistic 
output which looks great but you would have a  

82
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:51,311
very talented child if they're drawing that here's 
examples on some more types of prompts so a coffee  

83
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:57,710
shop logo low stylization is more minimalist the 
higher end gets more complex with this holographic  

84
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:03,751
car these first shots look pretty realistic as it 
goes up it gets more saturated and contrasty just  

85
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:09,911
looks more staged and edited in the selfies with 
Bigfoot the low stylize has poorly framed photos  

86
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:14,871
that feel more authentic as we go up it's more 
like they're taking perfect photos for Instagram  

87
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:19,710
and that totally gives away that it's AI the 
real big foot would never do that in a more  

88
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,711
artistic style this abstract Tree of Life As 
you move up it adds more contrast and depth or  

89
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:29,351
with a portrait shot like this one it starts out 
showing a lot of details in the face then starts  

90
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:34,951
to move younger and more of that filtered look 
so the low end follows the prompt more closely  

91
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:40,150
the higher end puts Aesthetics first the default 
of 100 is a pretty good balance between those I  

92
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,790
rarely take this to the high end but I do actually 
like to go between these values particularly on  

93
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:53,311
the low end like 50 or 75 to do that type Dash 
D- stylize space 50 you can also just type D-  

94
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:58,191
s either works zero usually doesn't look very 
good unless you have a really detailed prompt  

95
00:08:58,191 --> 00:09:04,631
a lot of the time I stay in the range of probably 
40 to 200 weirdness is to explore unconventional  

96
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:09,591
Aesthetics it's really fun it can lead to some 
very unique outcomes I usually keep this on the  

97
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:14,471
lower end but there is definitely times when 
you want to explore and get more unconventional  

98
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:21,271
here's a simple prompt and apple on a table so 
starts with a very literal and simple image then  

99
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:25,830
as I increase the weirdness I start to get more 
unique compositions angles and perspectives you  

100
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:31,431
would never expect how about clown sitting at 
a bus stop that might get a little weirder all  

101
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:35,391
right these first ones are a traditional looking 
clown two of them are just Pennywise and they're  

102
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:39,871
at normal looking bus stops at 600 we start 
getting one where the clown is off to the side  

103
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:45,831
on the ground with his foot sticking out or this 
one on the bottom right is not like any bus stop  

104
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:51,911
I've ever seen a lot more unusual at 12 00 I don't 
even want to open this one up to figure out what's  

105
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:56,470
going on here we' got more different poses and 
angles then it tests out some black and white and  

106
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:02,871
long exposures I ran a few at 3,000 we've got some 
selective coloring and just all sorts of weird bus  

107
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:07,550
stops and interesting poses and compositions this 
is a pretty mild prompt if you go with something  

108
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:13,991
more out there the weird parameter can definitely 
take you to some strange places I want to show one  

109
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:18,311
with a more specific prompt like this one which 
is a good example of how much detail you can add  

110
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:23,191
into a prompt in mid Journey it nailed every bit 
of this but when I increase the weirdness a little  

111
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:29,631
bit it quickly goes from beautiful Framing and 
people and poses to more unusual but it already  

112
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:34,711
has lost the setting of a fine dining restaurant 
and the lighting and color grading it retains most  

113
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:39,671
of the rest of the details through all of these 
but it defaults to less attractive people and  

114
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:44,591
poses like while they're in the middle of eating 
or looking bored or annoyed with each other if you  

115
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:49,431
want a weird image that is still conventionally 
attractive you can try increasing the styliz  

116
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:55,151
parameter variety is how varied the outputs 
are the lower values will have more consistent  

117
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:59,391
results and then higher values will lead to a 
wider range of compositions now I might bump  

118
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:03,631
this up when I'm exploring then when I start 
honing in on something I want and I'm getting  

119
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:07,991
specific with my prompt I'll start lowering that 
to get consistency and when you send this it's  

120
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:11,631
actually called the chaos parameter this one's 
pretty straightforward so here's just a couple  

121
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:18,031
examples this is all fairly minor variations then 
we start to get a wider range of interpretations  

122
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:24,071
so to summarize what these are and how they're 
different from each other stylize controls how  

123
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:29,231
strongly mid Journey's default aesthetic is 
applied weird controls how unusual an image  

124
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:35,231
is compared to previous mid Journey images chaos 
controls how diverse the initial grid images are  

125
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:39,911
from each other they're all different but all 
work together and influence each other as well  

126
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:44,111
they make it just really easy to use with these 
sliders or you can type them manually to get  

127
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:48,871
numbers in between for mode we have standard 
or raw raw gives you more control over your  

128
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:53,711
image and has less automatic beautification 
applied basically it listens more closely to  

129
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:58,951
your words and interprets them more literally is 
especially useful for photographic Styles if you  

130
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:04,751
want images that are as realistic as possible 
that will be style raw and low stylized value  

131
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:08,871
side by side comparisons are the best way 
to show this one I very often will just try  

132
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:17,951
both so here's against different photographic 
prompts now here with some more Artistic Styles

133
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:25,071
for versions version six is the default right now 
which is currently the latest version but you can  

134
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:29,311
select previous versions of mid Journey if you'd 
like to all the way back to version one six has  

135
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,991
the best prompt coherence and knowledge and is 
generally the most advanced and photo realistic  

136
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:39,831
it does tend to add a lot more details too which 
you may not want 5.2 was also great and can be  

137
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:44,711
a little easier to get results by just typing 
in keywords there's also nii which was trained  

138
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:49,151
to have a much wider knowledge of anime and 
illustration Style but it can give interesting  

139
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:53,310
results for other Styles as well so those are 
the main ones to use that generally speaking  

140
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:58,031
will give the highest quality you can go back 
further those images won't be as high quality  

141
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:05,351
but can be fun for an experiment personalize will 
use your own personal aesthetic preferences to  

142
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,591
influence the generation you have to rank 
image pairs to train the algorithm on your

143
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:17,071
preferences I love what my personalization does to 
the images but this is a bigger topic that needed  

144
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:21,551
a dedicated SE ction I'll go over this closer to 
the end it will just be turned off until then for  

145
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,431
Speed I'll just run a prompt at each of these 
speeds and let it run in real time as I explain  

146
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:30,191
it the default for Speed is fast that's what 
I use almost all of the time there is a cap on  

147
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:35,311
GPU time for every month depending on which plan 
you have it's roughly 1 minute of GPU time per  

148
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:40,991
generation that means the basic plan is around 
200 Generations per month on fast mode standard  

149
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,911
is around 900 Pro 1,800 and mega 3600 you also 
have the option to buy more GPU time if you're  

150
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:52,991
run out also if you're on the standard plan and 
up you get unlimited Generations in relax mode  

151
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:57,431
they do take longer to generate roughly 1 to 10 
minutes depending on the time of day so that can  

152
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:01,511
be a good option especially if you run out of 
minutes and don't want to buy more then there's  

153
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:06,670
also turbo mode which generates four times faster 
but uses twice as many subscription GPU minutes  

154
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:12,671
as a fast mode job you can earn free GPU hours by 
rating images under the tasks tab this is also how  

155
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:17,911
you train that personalization into mid Journey 
the top 2,000 rankers per day will get a free f  

156
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:22,271
fast hour this used to take only around like 5 
minutes of ranking to earn a fast hour but now  

157
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:26,830
that they've added personalization people are 
using it a lot more right now so it will most  

158
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:32,071
likely take longer fast and turbo We Done Quick 
but this relax mode is still generating there's  

159
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,951
two manual parameters I want to mention here 
before moving on to prompting the first is the  

160
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:41,471
no parameter for if there's something specific you 
don't want in your image so I want a bowl of fruit  

161
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:48,751
with no bananas dash dash no space bananas send 
that and it will come back with no ban bananas  

162
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:53,751
so that is a really useful one and the other I'll 
mention is seed so if you don't know mid journey  

163
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:59,231
and other diffusion models they start by creating 
an initial field of visual noise then they refine  

164
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,431
that noise then gradually transform that into 
the final image so each time you generate it  

165
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:08,711
uses a random seed number to generate the initial 
field of noise to get the seed number go down to  

166
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:17,151
more over here then click copy then seed now I'll 
run the same prompt with-- seed space then paste  

167
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:22,430
that number now here's what that looked like 
with and without the seed now here's that same  

168
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:27,711
seed with completely different prompts it does 
influence the scene but not in a way that's very  

169
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:32,671
predictable so I used the same seed for a lot of 
those comparisons like the child's drawing of a  

170
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:36,951
cat that's why the composition was so similar 
across those if I didn't specify it would have  

171
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:41,111
used a random seed each time and they would have 
looked a lot different like this you know still  

172
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:45,591
makes sense what the styliz parameter was doing 
but it's not as directec of a comparison all right  

173
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:50,031
one other thing I'll mention here is permutations 
it's not a parameter but you can use permutations  

174
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:54,430
to run different variations of your parameters 
or prompt without having to type each of them  

175
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:59,151
out I did that for most of these examples to run 
at each of the different stylized values use a  

176
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:05,231
curly bracket then each value separated by commas 
then close the curly bracket and when I send that  

177
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:09,231
you can see it's running the same prompt with 
each of those styliz values you can do the same  

178
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:13,431
thing with words in your prompt like if I want 
to test out different colors or camera angles  

179
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,911
just anything I'll demo more examples using that 
as we go through I know that all seems like a a  

180
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:22,070
lot if it's the first time you're hearing it but 
it all gets pretty intuitive once you understand  

181
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:27,111
them and have used them just a few times there are 
more parameters not in this box some based around  

182
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:31,351
references which are really powerful for guiding 
the scene but I want to switch it up for a bit and  

183
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:37,631
cover prompting before we get into that prompting 
is a big topic so it's a long section we've got  

184
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,231
all those parameters but they don't do anything 
unless they have a prompt to interpret the prompt  

185
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:46,831
is still the primary driver although that will 
change some when we get into reference images and  

186
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:51,711
it's important to not that there's no right way to 
prompt you will never find the perfect prompt it  

187
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,671
always takes some experimentation and guiding and 
bouts of serendipity to get something you like but  

188
00:16:56,671 --> 00:17:02,271
having a structure to prompt with can help a lot 
the simple approach is this scene subject details  

189
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:07,751
setting details style details I guess you could 
call it the four s's scene subject setting style  

190
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:13,231
and by scene I mean an overview of the scene using 
just generic archetypes and keywords all right so  

191
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:17,711
I'll start with a scene and then just build it out 
to show how it changes and anthropomorphic bar and  

192
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:27,151
owl exploring a dimly lit abandoned Temple I'll 
do 169 and style raw all right that looks good  

193
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:32,551
but not at all what I'm going for so I'll add some 
details about the owl the owl is wearing CT robes  

194
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:38,231
and a hood and holding a burning torch and calling 
back to the term you used in the first sentence  

195
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:42,271
in this case the owl will help mid Journey know 
what you're describing instead of thinking it's  

196
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:47,870
a new character same thing when describing the 
setting so I will call back with the temple has  

197
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:56,871
Dusty relics and Faded murals on the walls dark 
and mystical atmosphere with soft Eerie lighting  

198
00:17:56,871 --> 00:18:01,271
this already is pretty much exactly what I was 
looking for you I had this kind of cinematic  

199
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:06,831
dark fantasy vibe like pan Labyrinth or something 
along those lines if I wanted to describe that I  

200
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:12,670
could use the director's name in the style of gyo 
Del Toro or find the type of camera or film grain  

201
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:17,271
it was shot on I usually have better results from 
using film grains rather than camera names I mean  

202
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:23,110
which makes sense it looks like there were three 
film stocks used I'll go with 35 mm Kodak Vision  

203
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:30,111
2 500t 5218 and that looks a lot more consistent 
I could refine that a little more now that I have  

204
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:35,791
pan labyrinth in my head instead of soft Eerie 
lighting I'll switch to Loki lighting and Deep  

205
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:40,431
Shadows and to refine that I'd start experimenting 
with parameters from here like up and down in  

206
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:46,831
stylize you know 50 75 200 and 300 then try 
standard instead of raw then I'd just iterate  

207
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:51,991
until it's perfect but this looks great here I 
think you get the idea I'll do another one in a  

208
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:57,471
photo realistic style this time with multiple 
people all human candid shot of three friends  

209
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:03,271
at a cafe I'll send that then hit up to get the 
prompt pack and add some details I'll call back  

210
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:10,151
with the friend on the left is an African-American 
man wearing a blue button-up shirt then again I'll  

211
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:16,671
say the friend in the middle is a blonde Caucasian 
woman wearing a green blouse the friend on the  

212
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:23,591
right is an Asian woman wearing a sundress with a 
floral pattern iPhone photo I used the friend for  

213
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:27,511
each of those to make sure it knew I was referring 
to the original friends this is more important  

214
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:32,431
when you have more different archetypes like if 
I used a man a woman and a dog in the scene you  

215
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:38,471
can see what the defaults for Mid Journey tend to 
look like if you don't describe the subject this  

216
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:43,031
one looks great it nailed it in almost every one 
of them and like always I can test out different  

217
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:49,110
styliz values zero usually looks pretty rough but 
these others below have them looking at each other  

218
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:53,391
more like they're having a conversation which 
is what I was intending by saying candid shot  

219
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:58,111
although it would have helped to write that out 
in the prompt and the higher up you go the more  

220
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:03,791
posed and filtered they look and lower cut 
the shirts get apparently when you use style  

221
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:17,431
raw and words like candid and iPhone photo it's 
actually pretty insane how realistic they can look

222
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:24,591
[Music]

223
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:28,831
when I say details that's a really broad 
word there's a huge range of things that  

224
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:32,430
can include depending on what you're trying 
to create mid Journey breaks down words and  

225
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:37,511
phrases into smaller pieces called tokens so it 
takes those tokens Compares them to its training  

226
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:42,591
data to inform it how to generate the image some 
words will have more impact than others the ones  

227
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:47,031
with the biggest and most interesting impact 
are often called Power tokens I made a list  

228
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:51,071
of some of of my favorite Power tokens I've 
come across they can each have a big impact  

229
00:20:51,071 --> 00:21:17,311
on their own and of course you can use any of 
them in combination and see where it takes you

230
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:18,356
[Music]

231
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:23,551
[Music] now a lot of this so far has been based 
off of Photography terms but these can inform  

232
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:28,110
the scene across mediums you I could have done 
this in a different style pretty easily remove  

233
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:32,391
the previous style and just adding a couple 
words into the summary part of this prompt  

234
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,511
is enough then I could guide it more in 
the style details and depending on what  

235
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:41,191
style you're aiming for a good practice is to 
learn about that style having a vocabulary in  

236
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:45,511
a given medium is really helpful and overall if 
you don't already have that knowledge it's just  

237
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:49,591
a good excuse to learn about various art 
forms and artists and techniques there's  

238
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:54,511
a lot of places you can go to help learn about 
this stuff by far the best mid Journey focused  

239
00:21:54,511 --> 00:22:01,191
resource I have ever come across is mid library. 
it's an amazing way to explore Styles and artists  

240
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:06,191
and artistic techniques and how mid Journey 
interprets them it's an invaluable resource  

241
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:11,551
and an incredible way to get inspiration you can 
go to all styles and click Advanced filters for  

242
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:16,711
a bunch of ways to filter or the classifier tab 
has them categorized in various ways techniques  

243
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:21,751
fashion design ERS Architects filmmakers 
illustrators also has this area for artistic

244
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:33,671
[Music] techniques or this one for 
General modifiers which is more  

245
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:43,351
like [Music] keywords there's a bunch of 
really insightful guides here as well like  

246
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:47,471
this one about mimetic style emulation 
and the process to learn about a style  

247
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:51,711
in order to recreate it rather than typing an 
artist's name I'm not affiliated with site or  

248
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:55,511
anything by the way I've just found it extremely 
helpful and something that you can do with mid  

249
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:59,751
library is instead of using the words you 
can pull these into mid journey to use as  

250
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:03,431
style references I'll be getting to those 
in a little bit it's a whole different way  

251
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:09,151
of prompting that's done a lot more visually 
mid library is a great spot for that [Music]

252
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:17,231
too I ran just the prompt Dragon then added some 
of the coolest style words I found on Mid Library

253
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:49,111
[Music]

254
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:53,151
another way to get help with styles to use 
and words for your prompt is to upload an  

255
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:57,311
image then click the little I icon and 
it will describe the image for you so  

256
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:01,551
it will give the subject known artists 
with a similar style and descriptors  

257
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,591
you can go through and find interesting 
words to try out and see how they affect  

258
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:08,430
the image that can be a good way to get help 
describing a style if you're struggling with

259
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:18,231
that that basic prompting structure applies across 
most categories but there will be more specific  

260
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:23,351
terms you may need for things like architecture 
fashion or product photography those are a little  

261
00:24:23,351 --> 00:24:28,071
more Niche but easy to adapt to one I want to 
dive deeper on since it's pretty common but  

262
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:34,031
very different is Vector art you know for Logos 
branding or print products I'll start with a logo  

263
00:24:34,031 --> 00:24:39,191
generally I keep the aspect ratio as a square for 
Logos I'm just saying coffee shop logo would work  

264
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:44,591
there's a lot of specific words that can help 
some of my favorites are minimalist abstract  

265
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:50,110
brandmark and geometric or a combination of those 
you could do something more specific to your brand  

266
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:56,871
like Boutique psychedelic retro or maybe they're 
also a bookstore then of course experiment with  

267
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:01,591
the styliz parameter going up will affect things 
like minimalist or brandmark a little bit they'll  

268
00:25:01,591 --> 00:25:06,630
still get good results at high styliz values but 
something like psychedelic will have a big effect  

269
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:11,191
and we'll usually get too complex for a logo 
past 200 and logos are one that can be pretty  

270
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:17,271
interesting to try out famous logo designers 
names with like Milton Glazer Paul Rand Carolyn  

271
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:22,591
Davidson and Ivan CHF you can upload your Brand's 
color palette as a style reference if you have  

272
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:29,351
them as well I can add text to any of these two 
by adding quotation marks around the company name  

273
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:35,311
Kevin's coffee the text is perfect on this one 
I'll get into more specifics around generating  

274
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:40,870
text and how to fix these in just a minute but how 
did it know to put a guy with a beard on this one  

275
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:45,151
a lot of that will also apply to Vector art if 
you're making things for printing on t-shirts  

276
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:50,711
mugs or whatever it might be some additional words 
to use would be Vector art Vector graphic graphic  

277
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:57,351
design then things like icon emblem shirt design 
vyl sticker or clip art can be useful even if  

278
00:25:57,351 --> 00:26:02,351
you're not specifically making it for one of those 
silhouette or outline can be cool or some from the  

279
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:07,191
logos like geometric shapes abstract minimalist 
then for something on the complex side you could  

280
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:13,871
add complex or a wordlike illustration try out 
color palettes any combination of those things  

281
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:19,031
there's a couple ways to convert these into vector 
graphics Adobe Express has a free converter just  

282
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:25,511
use the PNG to SVG it works pretty well I used to 
use vectorizer doai it is better than the Adobe  

283
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:29,231
converter but it's not free anymore if you're 
doing this a lot it could be worth it to pay  

284
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:33,871
for that then bring it into Adobe Illustrator or 
whatever program to edit it further sometimes the  

285
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:38,191
results from these converters are weird to work 
with especially if you use a complex image back  

286
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:43,071
to the topic of text you can generate text in 
mid Journey but it is one of the more difficult  

287
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:47,670
things to get right consistently to get text just 
add quotation marks around the text text you want  

288
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:52,071
it is case sensitive and can also do special 
characters things that normally have text on  

289
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:58,951
them are a lot easier to get results with like 
paper license plates theater signs Billboards  

290
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,671
a lot of the time you'll get it first try on the 
easier things but for even slightly complex ideas  

291
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:08,511
it is not consistent so you'll usually need 
to roll a lot this one wasn't bad two of these  

292
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:13,191
are good if something is close like this one try 
running variations and just re-rolling the closest  

293
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:18,431
until you get it if there's minor issues you can 
try inpainting to add or remove letters or just  

294
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:23,871
imp paint over the whole text I got at least one 
usable one with each option the subtle variation  

295
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:30,151
strong variations and in painting it's actually 
very good at matching text to a style after the  

296
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:36,831
fact so I can grab one of these logos and select 
the area where I want my brand name to be I'll  

297
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:42,950
just use the word coffee and it matched this 
style perfectly with the colors and gradient  

298
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:47,071
and a pretty decent font so now I don't have 
to bring that into Photoshop or illustrator and  

299
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:51,630
the text it's ready to go before we move on 
from prompting here's a few more just rapid  

300
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:56,351
fire top prompting tips I'll actually start with 
a few from the mid Journey documentation then do  

301
00:27:56,351 --> 00:28:00,871
a bunch of my own the simpler you can make your 
phrasing the better instead of show me a picture  

302
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:04,911
of lots of blooming California poppies make 
them bright vibrant orange and draw them in  

303
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:10,431
an illustrated Style with colored pencils instead 
of that try bright orange California poppies drawn  

304
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:15,071
with colored pencils mid Journey breaks a prompt 
into smaller pieces called tokens and this first  

305
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:21,071
option gives a lot of unnecessary or imprecise 
tokens like show picture Lots the second option  

306
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:25,991
is only the words that are intended to direct 
The Prompt it's much more precise word choice  

307
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:31,711
is important the more specific you can be the 
better instead of big try High gigantic enormous  

308
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:37,991
plural words leave a lot to chance if you say cats 
that could end up in 3 10 or 100 specifying three  

309
00:28:37,991 --> 00:28:43,191
cats would be much more helpful focus on what you 
want instead of what you don't want prompting a  

310
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:47,791
birthday party with no cake will usually end up 
with a cake if you want to make sure something  

311
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:52,870
isn't there use the no parameter specify what 
you want anything you don't specify will let  

312
00:28:52,871 --> 00:28:57,391
mid Journey fill in the details so include every 
element that is important to you whether that's  

313
00:28:57,391 --> 00:29:03,711
the subject medium environment lighting color 
mood composition it could be a lot more or a lot  

314
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:08,591
less if you're trying for a full body shot specify 
the shoes M Journey cuts off the bottom a lot of  

315
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:13,551
the time if you specify the shoes it will almost 
always generate the full body the easiest way to  

316
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:18,870
get something cinematic is to add either cinematic 
still or thir mm cinematic if you're struggling  

317
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:22,751
to figure out how to prompt for something try 
searching on the explore tab often you'll find  

318
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:28,911
inspiration or a prompt to build off try switching 
between style raw and standard that little change  

319
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:33,791
can make a big difference if you want some random 
images forget everything I just went over and add  

320
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:40,110
emojis into the prompt box and see what happens on 
that note just generally experiment again there is  

321
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:45,391
no perfect way to prompt utilize these tips and 
also try the opposite just experiment you never  

322
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:49,031
know where it might take you now that we have 
some cool images there's some next steps you  

323
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:52,471
can take one when you click on one I've shown 
a couple of these already but I'll dive into  

324
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:57,711
them further we have very subtle and strong the 
very subtle will give four new images that have  

325
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:03,111
similar composition and colors to the original but 
with some subtle changes then the very strong will  

326
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:07,591
have more differences in the composition colors 
and details almost every time I have an image  

327
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:12,190
I like or once I'm getting close I'll run these 
to get some more options you can upscale subtle  

328
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:17,151
and creative both of these will double the size 
of your image subtle will keep the details very  

329
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:21,871
similar to the original then creative will add 
new details to the image you can experiment with  

330
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:28,871
each to see which works best for any given image 
both the upscaler do an amazing job if you have an  

331
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:33,231
image where the face is a little off or distorted 
Sometimes using a creative upscale will fix

332
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:44,991
it rerun will rerun the exact same prompt as is 
with all the parameters included reframe has a  

333
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:50,071
few functions within it you can quickly change the 
aspect ratio under reframe then I can click Start  

334
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:56,271
or end to move the image into a different spot and 
it will generate the missing areas under Zoom you  

335
00:30:56,271 --> 00:31:03,511
can zoom out all the way up to 2x while you're 
on reframe or Zoom you can click edit prompt and  

336
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:07,951
change anything about the prompt to influence 
what it generates in those areas it's expanding  

337
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:13,671
into I could pan and add new people or objects 
into a shot or as you zoom out you can zoom out  

338
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:20,791
into entirely different scenes there's some really 
interesting ways that can be used there's an old  

339
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:26,231
video I made where I uploaded an image of my desk 
setup and zoomed out and panned into all sorts of  

340
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:33,191
different scenes then edit it all together I 
can change up the scene with every Zoom or I  

341
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:41,591
could pan to different locations I can do that 
in any direction I'd like and there's even more  

342
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:48,791
possibilities to throw some other AI tools on 
top maybe even add a character this has been a  

343
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:53,071
lot of fun I've also seen the door Brothers 
make some really creative music videos using

344
00:31:53,071 --> 00:32:06,071
that also you can change the prompt without using 
the reframe or Zoom how about a lobster body what  

345
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:10,951
that does is actually called remix strong if I 
click this more options button then select remix  

346
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:15,191
it shows that I've already ran a remix strong 
because that's what I just did but there is also  

347
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:20,511
this subtle option here I'll use that as well for 
a comparison when I click it the prompt pops up at  

348
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:25,110
the top and I can change it I do actually like to 
use remix subtle a lot it's the best way to make  

349
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:29,311
changes while retaining a very similar composition 
to the original super good for just quickly  

350
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:33,870
iterating on things that got way creepier than I 
was expecting with the lobster so I'll switch to  

351
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:38,311
something else for the other tools sometimes I'll 
really like the image but there's one part that's  

352
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:44,511
a little off about it that definitely happens 
repaint is inpainting or selecting a specific  

353
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:49,551
part of the image to change instead of the entire 
thing let's say I want to have open eyes here  

354
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:55,191
select with either the rectangle or the lasso tool 
you can leave the prompt or change it I'll WR what  

355
00:32:55,191 --> 00:33:04,871
I want for this one and there it is this comes in 
handy a lot like if you've got some hands that are  

356
00:33:04,871 --> 00:33:12,111
off use repaint and it should fix it eventually 
sometimes it can take a few tries or replace a  

357
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:16,871
character you can even replace a face with a face 
of your choice using the character reference which  

358
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:22,831
we'll get to soon references help in many ways to 
get results you want faster and more easily the  

359
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:27,390
overview of these and how they differ is a good 
place to start image prompt pulls in more of the  

360
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:32,791
structure of the image the subjects forms and 
motifs style reference focuses on the aesthetic  

361
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:36,951
like the lighting colors more like the vibe of 
the image character reference looks specifically  

362
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:41,191
at a character and will'll try to match the face 
most importantly then depending on how you adjust  

363
00:33:41,191 --> 00:33:46,191
the weight it will also pull in clothing colors 
and style even more simplified would be structure  

364
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,711
aesthetic character a lot is now done through 
references rather than prompting overall for  

365
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:55,831
me it's a lot more fun to blend and direct things 
with images rather than language just feels more  

366
00:33:55,831 --> 00:34:00,511
intuitive and also faster but words are still the 
best for positioning and describing subjects in a  

367
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:04,911
scene so I'll cover how each of these work first 
before how to use them all together for each of  

368
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:09,351
these all you have to do is drag an image in 
I'll use this little mushroom again then select  

369
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:13,031
which type of reference you want it to be if 
you want the same image to be multiple types  

370
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:17,351
of references hold shift and click the others 
for image prompt it's the the little picture  

371
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:22,231
that's what it defaults to I'll try to change this 
style to a pencil sketch of a mushroom that looks  

372
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:27,271
great it's a very similar composition and type of 
mushroom but in a completely different style this  

373
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:32,110
looks good but we can also adjust how strongly the 
image influences the output with the image weight  

374
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:39,710
parameter D- IW then a number between 0 and 3 four 
version 6 between 0 and two four version 5 so I'll  

375
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:48,710
run a permutation with the weights. 25.5 75 1 2 
and 3 went down at 25 is a basic pencil sketch  

376
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:54,991
0.5 has that smaller mushroom more consistently as 
we go up more we start getting more color and more  

377
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:59,271
of the forest but straying a bit from the pencil 
sketch and you don't just have to try switching  

378
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:03,911
style I'll use this same image reference and just 
type wizard at the default of one it gets me a  

379
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:08,791
similar composition but with a wizard and the 
hat is slightly mushroom shaped and has these  

380
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:12,391
dots on it there's also more mushrooms within the 
image and for reference here's just running the  

381
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:16,431
prompt wizard without an image reference it's 
a big difference here's that different weight  

382
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:22,071
below one looks great still when you go up to 
two it doesn't look like a wizard with mushroom  

383
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:27,431
characteristics more like a mushroom with a few 
wizard characteristics like the more flowy beard  

384
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:32,231
likee stem and the cap a little more shaped like 
a wizard hat the cap with the wizard hat shape is  

385
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:36,351
actually pretty awesome you can also use multiple 
image references it can be fun to just browse the  

386
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:43,431
explore Tab and find random cool images to use 
here's a cool double exposure I'll use that then  

387
00:35:43,431 --> 00:35:47,511
this looks like a version of the girl with pearl 
earrings I'll use that and send it let's see what  

388
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:53,591
we got that actually looks pretty cool I'll jump 
to my likes Tab and just mix up a bunch of random  

389
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:57,991
ones together and see what happens doing this with 
a specific goal in mind is great but sometimes  

390
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:02,191
just throwing random images into the slot machine 
can be cool too not necessarily to end up with a  

391
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:06,591
finished image but something cool to work with 
further or get inspiration from here's what I  

392
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:11,270
got some of these are cool nothing spectacular you 
could add a prompt into this process as well to  

393
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:17,191
guide it more now I'll go back to that mushroom 
image but switch this to a style reference  

394
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:21,471
instead of an image prompt I'll prompt it with 
wizard again and submit this time it retains  

395
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:26,311
essentially none of the original composition in 
structure but uses the same colors and Vibe as a  

396
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:30,431
comparison here's the default style reference and 
default image prompt next to each other then just  

397
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:34,431
to reinforce what the style reference is doing 
I will switch up the prompt and we can see the  

398
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:38,631
scene changes but the style Remains the Same and 
just like with image prompts we can control how  

399
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:43,951
strongly the style is applied by using-- S SW 
for style weight then a number between zero and  

400
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:49,111
a th000 here's that same prompt at different style 
weight in this case I prefer it in the lower range  

401
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:56,031
but it will vary from image to [Music] image again 
you can bring in multiple images to use as style  

402
00:36:56,031 --> 00:37:00,911
references to blend those Styles just using the 
prompt wizard I'll throw a bunch of random Styles  

403
00:37:00,911 --> 00:37:06,671
together do single references some with two some 
with four we'll see where it goes it's really fun  

404
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:16,310
and starts to feel more like mixing paints on 
a palette and some of these look just amazing

405
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:33,231
[Music]  

406
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:37,271
this is so powerful and you can combine 
style references with image prompts as  

407
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:41,551
well and again to use a single image as 
both hold down shift and click the other  

408
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:46,231
that's what I did to get this mushroom carousel 
there was some remixing and in painting as well

409
00:37:48,471 --> 00:37:53,511
in addition to these image-based style references 
there's also unique codes assigned to styles that  

410
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:57,631
mid Journey can create you can use that to 
have consistent style applied across images  

411
00:37:57,631 --> 00:38:02,111
that also gets extremely powerful I have links 
to some databases where people have been posting  

412
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:05,991
their curated Styles you can use that's coming 
up soon but first let's move on to this last  

413
00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:10,271
one here character reference so this lets you 
create consistent characters and this was the  

414
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:14,831
most requested feature in mid Journey ever until 
they finally implemented it it works best with  

415
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:19,551
characters you generated within mid Journey but 
you can use non- mid Journey images too I'll demo  

416
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:24,071
both I'll just pick a random character from one of 
the prompts earlier this one has some uniqueness  

417
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:29,551
drag it up to the prompt bar then switch it to 
a character reference now I'll run a permutation  

418
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:36,631
woman sitting in a cafe walking through a forest 
playing chess underwater hiking cyber Punk Warrior  

419
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:41,750
exploring a cave and these look great we can 
see her across all these different scenes it  

420
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:46,631
made an effort to match her clothing as well 
there is a character weight parameter D- CW  

421
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:50,911
that adjusts how much it tries to match 
the default of 100 tries to match the Face  

422
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:55,711
clothing and accessories lowering it all the way 
to zero will only match the face and the clothes  

423
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:59,711
are rarely perfect so a lot of the time I have 
this at zero as you can tell from these it will  

424
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:04,191
work across different scenes Styles and camera 
angles it also works with different emotions if  

425
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:07,790
you prompt for them all right now we've got that 
with a mid Journey generated character but how  

426
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:12,431
about an image of me this works sort of just not 
as well so I'll try to convert this into a couple  

427
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:18,991
Styles it does an okay job definitely not perfect 
with enough rerolls you can get pretty close  

428
00:39:18,991 --> 00:39:23,431
you'll never get it exact but you can get a lot 
closer there is also the ability to inpaint with  

429
00:39:23,431 --> 00:39:27,871
character references if you get a generation where 
the face is off or if you want multiple character  

430
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:33,071
references in one image you can add them after the 
fact so this is a little weird to do right now I'm  

431
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:37,431
sure they'll make this easier at some point but to 
use character reference within repaint you need a  

432
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:43,271
URL for the image I can go to the picture of this 
woman I've been using rightclick then copy image  

433
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:48,911
URL now I'll go to repaint on one of these images 
from before with the group of friends then select  

434
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:54,631
the woman in the middle I'll change the prompt and 
just write the woman in the middle is a cockasian  

435
00:39:54,631 --> 00:40:01,111
with red hair then-- CF space paste that image 
address and it's ready to send on the generation  

436
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:04,471
we can see it has replace the character 
and matches the lighting and style really

437
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:14,511
well if I wanted I could replace these others as 
well you can also experiment with using things  

438
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:19,671
other than a character like uploading a texture 
gradient or even just a color this is super hit  

439
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:23,671
and miss I'll show some Explorations I've 
done getting a guitar in different textures  

440
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:28,551
works pretty well it can get the texture almost 
perfectly which is amazing and really difficult  

441
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:33,311
to do in any other way so if there's any reason 
you want a very specific texture on something and  

442
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:37,391
depending on the character weight you use it may 
bleed into other parts of the scene using just a  

443
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:42,111
color can work to get a very particular Hue onto 
something but definitely can run into issues with  

444
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:46,591
bleeding into other parts of the scene depending 
on how you use it this worked by in painting as  

445
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:53,711
well this one I thought was pretty cool I wanted 
a man with a cube head instead of describing the  

446
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:58,111
cube I could use a cube as a character reference 
and it worked really well I also tried seeing if I  

447
00:40:58,111 --> 00:41:02,830
could replace a guitar so if I had someone playing 
a guitar across multiple scenes the guitar would  

448
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:08,231
remain the same it didn't really work I could get 
a new guitar with a similar style which is helpful  

449
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:12,191
but not as perfect of a match as I'd hoped better 
than not doing it at all though that's been a lot  

450
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:17,031
of fun experiment see what happens you can 
combine all of these reference features I'll  

451
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:24,071
use this character again but I want it in this 
style with a similar composition to this image  

452
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:29,431
I'll change the weights of some of those and send 
that you can see how much control that gives me  

453
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:36,351
I've been primarily moving towards prompting with 
images as much as possible now on to one of my new  

454
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:40,471
favorite parts of mid Journey instead of using 
images to give context to the style another way  

455
00:41:40,471 --> 00:41:45,311
to do this is with style reference seeds which 
is a code for a style mid Journey knows how to  

456
00:41:45,311 --> 00:41:49,231
generate and will will give a consistent style 
across Generations this is where things get the  

457
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:53,471
most fun there's some databases all link to where 
people categorize some of the best srfs they've  

458
00:41:53,471 --> 00:42:00,431
found I'll go through those in a second you do D- 
srf space then type a number between zero and 4  

459
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:06,991
billion you can also type-- srf space random and 
mid Journey will pick a random number for you in  

460
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:11,551
the output you can see it replaced that srf random 
with this long number that's the style reference  

461
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:17,151
seed these are two random Styles they look pretty 
cool to get more I'll add that same thing srf  

462
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:24,270
random then I'll add a parameter that I haven't 
mentioned yet D- repeat 10 repeat runs your prompt  

463
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:29,151
however many times you specify with everything 
the same prompt parameters and references but  

464
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:33,591
in this case since I used srf random it will 
choose a different random seed each time so I  

465
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:46,911
can explor a wide range of Aesthetics there's some 
really cool ones here some weird ones too [Music]  

466
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:57,631
so to drive home what this is doing I will 
copy that srf and use it with a completely  

467
00:42:57,631 --> 00:43:05,031
different prompt woman walking through 
a forest copy the srf now cityscape how  

468
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:10,791
about a comic book superhero and howow 
flying I'll do that with a few of these  

469
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:15,911
srfs this is so powerful for getting 
consistent Styles across Generations

470
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:37,311
[Music]

471
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:41,471
and just like with the visual style references you 
can use the style weight parameter for these with  

472
00:43:41,471 --> 00:43:46,951
a number from 0 to 1,000 100 being the default 
you'll have to find the balance of how strong the  

473
00:43:46,951 --> 00:43:51,591
style is and how much you're trying to influence 
it with your prompt and then what you want to show  

474
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:55,790
through each srf will act a little differently 
generally you can use them across different  

475
00:43:55,791 --> 00:44:00,631
mediums by prompting but some of them will be very 
strong Styles and harder to guide in different  

476
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:05,431
directions so that's how they work they're super 
fun but it's a complete slot machine to do it this  

477
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:10,471
way and takes time to find really good ones people 
have been calling that mining for srfs the process  

478
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:15,511
is fun but can burn a lot of fast hours there's 
a few people that I've found mining for srfs  

479
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:20,071
and indexing them I have three pretty solid ones 
I'll link to all of them below the first is Ali  

480
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:24,631
Jewels she posts some really cool ones on X and 
just a lot of great mid Journey related content  

481
00:44:24,631 --> 00:44:28,830
she's a great follow she's also been building 
out this visual index of style references she  

482
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:32,591
did recently switch it to paid to view the full 
thing but there's still hundreds to explore for

483
00:44:32,591 --> 00:44:38,991
free this one looks cool I will copy 
that and run it with wizard I'll just  

484
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:45,831
keep using wizard as my Benchmark 
I'll just run a bunch of these

485
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:52,311
[Music]

486
00:44:52,311 --> 00:44:56,671
now this one is made by Wade McMaster with 
Creator impact I don't know how many are here  

487
00:44:56,671 --> 00:45:01,991
but there's a lot so I'll grab a few of those 
and then here's another one from Charlie Q it  

488
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:06,751
doesn't have as many but there's some really 
good ones and in the last mid Journey office  

489
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:11,831
hours David did mention that they're working on 
some sort of sraf Explorer no details on when or  

490
00:45:11,831 --> 00:45:15,911
what that will look like but it will be amazing 
if they make an easy way to navigate to explore  

491
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:49,451
these right on the site here's all my different 
Wizards there's some amazing stuff in here [Music]

492
00:45:49,451 --> 00:45:53,191
[Music]

493
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:56,830
another note on these is just like with 
using images as style references you can  

494
00:45:56,831 --> 00:46:01,751
combine multiple srfs together just add 
one then press space and add another now  

495
00:46:01,751 --> 00:46:06,151
it will merge those Styles the other 
way is to click on the srf and it will  

496
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:11,671
pop into the prompt bar I think these 
two will be a cool combo here is from  

497
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:16,870
those random numbers I typed then this 
is the two I picked these are really

498
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:24,551
cool you can also adjust how much of 
each style is applied add a double  

499
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:28,270
colon than the relative weight for 
each so in this case the first style  

500
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:33,271
will be twice as strong as the second 
style now this is with those weights

501
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:40,991
reversed personalization is the newest feature 
they've rolled out and it is amazing usually when  

502
00:46:40,991 --> 00:46:46,031
you write a prompt the algorithms fill in all 
the missing information with their own preferen  

503
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:49,871
that gives mid Journey its own default 
Aesthetics which is really the combined  

504
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:55,111
preferences and biases of the entire Community 
with personalization mid Journey will learn what  

505
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:59,310
you like and fill in the blanks with your 
own preferences so this will be completely  

506
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:05,711
different for every person you can use it on 
any prompt by adding d-p or you can go to the  

507
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:09,830
parameters and switch it to on and it will use 
it on every prompt without having to type it  

508
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:15,631
each time here's what it looked like for the 
prompt wizard with and without my personaliz

509
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:23,671
my personal code is right here and I could share 
that and anyone will be able to generate with my  

510
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:28,991
personalization which leans a lot more dark and 
surreal but I'd assume most people will prefer  

511
00:47:28,991 --> 00:47:33,831
their own codes that's kind of the idea there's 
more to go over and I'll run a lot more prompts  

512
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:40,591
with this but first to get one you need to rank 
at least 200 images go to tasks then click rank  

513
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:44,591
images and then it will have image pairs that 
pop up so select which image you like better  

514
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:49,111
choose based off of Aesthetics not how perfectly 
it followed the prompt I don't even read the  

515
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:55,391
prompts when I'm ranking these to go faster use 
one to select the left image two to select the  

516
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:59,911
Right image and three to skip sometimes you will 
have completely different prompts and styles other  

517
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:04,151
times it will be the same prompt with similar 
images just subtle differences then if you're ever  

518
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:09,270
just not sure which one to pick click three to 
skip do this until you hit at least 200 I assume  

519
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:14,271
doing more will help once it's all trained up 
it will work anytime you hit d-p there's nothing  

520
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:45,511
further you need to do I ran a few more simple 
prompts with and without it for a comparison

521
00:48:45,511 --> 00:48:47,021
[Music]

522
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:50,905
[Music] [Applause]

523
00:48:50,905 --> 00:48:52,631
[Music]  

524
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:58,151
I love what mine does on these simpler prompts 
I've been blown away at how much more I like them  

525
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:10,991
actually here's on some of the other prompts 
used throughout this [Music] video sometimes  

526
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:15,351
when I'm going for something more specific it can 
conflict with what I'm trying to get so I'll have  

527
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:20,071
to to turn it off for certain types of images or 
adjust how much personalization is applied which  

528
00:49:20,071 --> 00:49:24,750
you can do with the styliz parameter normally that 
applies to how much of mid Journey's aesthetic  

529
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:28,911
is applied when you switch to personalization it 
controls how much of your personalized aesthetic  

530
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:33,511
is applied I've been liking mine at pretty 
much every level you can also combine this  

531
00:49:33,511 --> 00:49:41,711
with style references and other parameters I'll 
use these two srfs again I'll wait the first one

532
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:50,991
Higher I'll go with with raw make sure 
personalize is on I'll add just a little  

533
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:56,791
bit of chaos then an aspect ratio of 32 
and I'll lower my personalization a bit  

534
00:49:56,791 --> 00:50:07,151
at stylize 50 and wow these turned out so 
good that style combo fits the vibe of this

535
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:13,911
perfectly there's two more parameters I want 
to mention I didn't mention them alongside the  

536
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:18,671
others because they have very specific uses and 
aren't as common first is tile this generates  

537
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:23,071
images that can be used as repeating tiles 
to create seamless patterns this could be for  

538
00:50:23,071 --> 00:50:28,671
textures wallpapers Fabrics or even something 
like a 3D scene how about multicolored Stones  

539
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:34,231
pattern first I'll send it without tile now I'll 
add Dash Das tile at the end and send that I'll  

540
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:39,751
download one from each of these and take it into 
a seamless pattern Checker this first one doesn't  

541
00:50:39,751 --> 00:50:45,631
work now I'll upload the tiled version and it's 
perfectly seamless now there's also super tiling  

542
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:49,191
which is something I learned from mid Library I'm 
not sure if he's the original person that came up  

543
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:53,951
with it but I'll do a quick demo of that I'll 
copy this prompt to get a where's Waldo style  

544
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:59,791
I'll change it up a little bit how about a vibrant 
futuristic city all right this one looks cool I'll  

545
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:05,351
test it in the pattern Checker and that looks 
really repetitive the super tiling trick will  

546
00:51:05,351 --> 00:51:11,391
make it less repetitive open that image up and 
use very region then select most of the image  

547
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:15,551
but leave some space on each side now when 
I send that it will replace that area but  

548
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:21,511
remain seamless and now when I put these 
all together there's a lot more variety I  

549
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:25,871
essentially have a much larger and much more 
detailed tile now so here's the before and

550
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:38,871
after another unique use for the tile parameter 
is something I came across from Nick St Pierre  

551
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:44,311
you can use it to convert an image into a seamless 
360° photo so this is really cool I had actually  

552
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:48,671
done this before using generative fill to hide the 
seam but I'd never thought to try it with the tile  

553
00:51:48,671 --> 00:51:54,790
parameter I'll do a prompt with a panoramic 
view of a volcano an aspect ratio of 21 then  

554
00:51:54,791 --> 00:52:00,271
add the tile parameter actually I ran that again 
to add some lava and this one looks awesome so I  

555
00:52:00,271 --> 00:52:08,151
will upscale that then I'll use this website 
I found for viewing 360° photos just drag it  

556
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:15,750
in and it's looking pretty solid so I'll switch 
to the VR View and this looks amazing amazing I  

557
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:21,711
can rotate all around and never find a seam so 
I would probably still use the generative fill  

558
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:26,390
method since a lot of the results I got turn out 
a little weird when mid Journey tries to make the  

559
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:30,911
top and bottom tilable too especially when I tried 
going wider so I just really quick show how to do  

560
00:52:30,911 --> 00:52:35,391
it in generative fill so this is one without the 
tile parameter so it would not work as is I'll  

561
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:45,471
bring that into Photoshop go to filter other 
offset then drag it to the side of bit that's  

562
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:52,391
good now I'll select the rectangular Marquee and 
drag that over the seam and use generative fill  

563
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:56,431
no prompt needed this one's a little weird 
since there's light and dark right next to  

564
00:52:56,431 --> 00:53:00,071
each other but yeah it'll still work 
that's it export and bring it into the

565
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:13,911
viewer there was a really amazing example in the 
comments on Nick's post of all these people on  

566
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:18,631
the Titanic they used magnic to upscale you would 
never get this many perfectly sharp faces out of  

567
00:53:18,631 --> 00:53:23,350
mid journey magnific is amazing it's hard 
for me to ever recommend because it is so  

568
00:53:23,351 --> 00:53:30,351
expensive but the results you can get from it are 
unparalleled the stop parameter will finish a job  

569
00:53:30,351 --> 00:53:35,271
partway through the process to create blurrier or 
less detailed results so I'll grab the seed from  

570
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:42,911
that woman I've been using you type Das Das stop 
space and a number between Zer and 100 the 100  

571
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:46,911
is the default basically just finishing the full 
job so so as we're watching this generate at 100  

572
00:53:46,911 --> 00:53:52,231
basically what the stop parameter does is just 
stopping it at different parts of this process  

573
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:57,911
so here's how that looks at each of the different 
stop values it can be useful at 80 and 90 to get  

574
00:53:57,911 --> 00:54:03,871
less detailed and softer images V6 tends to add a 
lot of detail so I use it to lower that sometimes  

575
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:08,751
I have found very few other uses than that I've 
tried it impr prompts where you want like a shaky  

576
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:12,431
cam or motion blur you know like someone being 
chased through the woods but really I can get  

577
00:54:12,431 --> 00:54:17,071
a good result just by prompting the other thing I 
have used for is when I generate something that's  

578
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:21,551
going to be a background that I know I'm going 
to add blur to in Photoshop so in particular for  

579
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:26,951
thumbnail backgrounds I'll use stop at 60 to 80 
I'll still typically add some blur later but I'll  

580
00:54:26,951 --> 00:54:30,591
be able to get a better idea of what it's going 
to look like right within mid Journey so that's  

581
00:54:30,591 --> 00:54:35,790
helpful um that's about all I've ever used it for 
where I actually found it useful multi- prompting  

582
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:41,551
only works well on V5 and earlier this is mostly 
because V6 is so much better with understanding  

583
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:45,191
language it's just not necessary about how 
this works just in case you need it separate  

584
00:54:45,191 --> 00:54:50,711
Concepts using colon colon as a separator you can 
assign relative importance to each concept using a  

585
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:56,991
number right after the colons so using space ship 
that gives you a space ship but space colon colon  

586
00:54:56,991 --> 00:55:02,591
ship gives you a ship in space if you give more 
importance to space there will be more space in  

587
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:06,830
the image or more importance to ship there will 
be a bigger ship and these numbers are all based  

588
00:55:06,831 --> 00:55:12,311
on their values relative to each other so 2 to 
1 is the same as 100 to 50 and again that just  

589
00:55:12,311 --> 00:55:17,511
does not work very well in V6 there's also 
a parameter D- video this one does only work  

590
00:55:17,511 --> 00:55:21,231
in Discord the only thing I've mentioned so far 
where that's the case all it does is make a short  

591
00:55:21,231 --> 00:55:26,271
video out of the image being generated it does 
look pretty cool to use it in Discord you add--  

592
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:32,551
video to the end of your prompt then once the job 
is finished click add reaction then select the  

593
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:37,231
envelope emoji and you will get a DM from the 
mid Journey bot with a link to view the video

594
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:45,151
at so just another parameter that's there if you  

595
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:48,310
ever need it it's not generative text a 
video or anything although mid journey  

596
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:51,951
is actually working on a video model 
they say they are just not close on

597
00:55:51,951 --> 00:56:01,071
it I'll use this prompt again for one 
more example I can get rid of this I'll  

598
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:07,391
use this srf it's a really interesting one I was 
experimenting with for parameters I'll leave it  

599
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:17,391
at 169 add a little bit of chaos switch to raw 
and turn personalize on this is a really strong  

600
00:56:17,391 --> 00:56:23,911
srf so I'll lower the weight to 20 I'll also 
lower my personalization to 50 and that should  

601
00:56:23,911 --> 00:56:34,031
be good I'll send it these are awesome that srf 
gives such a unique Vibe I've ran it a few more

602
00:56:34,031 --> 00:56:39,911
times I think I like this one the

603
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:48,911
most that is essentially all I know about 
mid Journey packed into one video I hope  

604
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:52,511
