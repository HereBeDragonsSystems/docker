1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,760
Today's episode, we are going to talk

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,319
about an introduction to Vibe Marketing.

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,920
Now, if you're listening to this, you've

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,000
probably heard of Vibe Coding, but you

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,120
might have not have heard of Vibe

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,880
Marketing, and I'm going to break down

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,360
exactly what it is, why you should care,

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,799
why this is going to propel your

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,119
business, your startup idea, and why

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,960
most people should actually be focusing

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,640
on Vibe Marketing a little more than

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,720
Vibe coding. I'm actually going to give

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,359
away a bunch of workflows of how you can

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,599
do Vibe Marketing. Towards the end, I'm

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,840
going to talk about some of the tools uh

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,320
that you could use. And by the end of

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,920
this, you should have a pretty good

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,520
foundation of how you can get going uh

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,640
do vibe marketing, use AI, use agents to

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,360
automate a lot of the tedious marketing

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,370
tasks.

22
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:52,879
[Music]

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,600
So, uh, before I begin, if you're new to

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,440
the channel, new to the startup ideas

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,120
podcast, why you should listen to me.

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,879
I've started and sold three ventureback

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,719
companies. I was an adviser to Tik Tok.

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,519
I was an adviser to Reddit. And, uh, I

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,000
am a co-founder in LCA, which is a

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
design agency for the AI age. We

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
literally work with pretty much all the

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,799
biggest AI companies or software

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,439
companies looking to get into AI. So I

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,320
know a thing or two about um consumer

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,040
businesses, growing them, marketing uh

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,880
and

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,439
AI. So I posted this on on X and it went

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,840
absolutely uh viral. I said vibe

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
marketing is the new marketing. So when

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
you think about what is vibe coding,

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,920
right? Vibe coding is using tools like

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
bolt, raplet, lovable. What is uh Vibe

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,680
marketing? Well, it's actually the

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,759
combination of some of these Vibe coding

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,079
tools with things like Gum Loop, Manis,

46
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,640
N8N, Tascade, and it's using AI agents

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,520
and workflows to actually go and build

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,759
marketing

49
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,320
campaigns. So, my co-founder, uh, Boring

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,479
Marketer, and shout out, uh, shout out

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,320
to him, James, for helping me kind of

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,159
put some of these present, uh,

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,680
presentation materials together. He's

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
the goat when it comes to VI market

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
marketing. Uh he said something that I

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,239
totally uh resonate with which is

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,800
marketing will resemble highfrequency

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,599
stock trading in the near future. Agents

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,760
working 24/7 monitoring surfacing

60
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,000
opportunities personalized micro

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,520
interactions. You'll be like a portfolio

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,800
manager or day trader adjusting risk

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
deploying money based on real-time

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
market signals. I totally believe that's

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,599
where we're going. Why is VI marketing

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,680
even happening in the first place? I

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
think it's because three things have

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
actually converged at the same time. One

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
is that AI got good enough at marketing

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,720
tasks. So now agents can actually handle

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
the execution. I don't even think that

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,120
was true a month ago, by the way. So

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,760
this is happening in real time. Two,

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,080
Vibe coding tools made automation

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,640
accessible to non-developers. No coding

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
required. And three, the custom tool

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
building costs have basically collapsed.

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,239
So you can build personalized software

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,080
for pennies basically. Um and because of

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
that, you know, you can basically do a

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,280
lot of customized marketing campaigns.

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,360
The old world and the new world. The old

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
world of marketing was basically having

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,239
these bigger teams, 10 specialists, SEO

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,920
people, copywriters, designers,

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
analytics people, media buyers. These

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,159
guys were these people are basically

88
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,080
working in silos. you know, they're in

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,760
meetings, they're in Slack threads, and

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
it takes a while to launch when you have

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,599
a lot of people. This new world, and

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,599
which gets me so excited about this new

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,440
world is, you know, you don't have to

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
raise millions of dollars or have a huge

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
team to actually go and uh and run with

96
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
this. You basically need a single smart

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,879
marketer with taste, of course. Uh pair

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
that with AI agents and workflows. We'll

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,200
get into workflows by the end. I will

100
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm I'm not going to leave you hanging.

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,959
testing tons of marketing angles in real

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799
time with hundreds hundreds of AI agents

103
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,120
running the show launching in days, not

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,920
weeks. So, uh before we do get into the

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,519
workflows, let's just talk about what

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,480
you need to get started, uh in the Vibe

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
marketing toolkit. Uh some of this may

108
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
be obvious to to some people. You're

109
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,079
going to want to have a vibe coding tool

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,079
like Replet, Bolt, Lovable. So, um, you

111
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,160
know, it it is crazy that you can with a

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,320
prompt go make me a website for new

113
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,560
homeowners that help subscribe to

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
exclusive content with flexible payment

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,560
options. I mean, today, the fact that

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,600
you can actually put in a prompt and get

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,800
a prototype uh is a gamecher when you're

118
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
creating a lot of these uh marketing

119
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880
campaigns. Uh, you're going to want to

120
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,160
play with something like NAN. So, NAN,

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
you know, this is their their homepage,

122
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
flexible AI workflow automation for

123
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
technical teams. So, you see they have

124
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,440
this um

125
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,400
flowchart. Uh so, you can basically

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
create these flowcharts that basically

127
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,040
help you drag and drop and automate uh

128
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,560
with AI agents um and different tools.

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,880
But I will say one thing, I think NAND

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,240
is for, you know, more of the experts.

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,680
Um, so, uh, definitely fun to play

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,520
around with, but you know, you do need

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,080
to be pretty savvy to use it. If people

134
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,960
want, I can do an NAN, uh, demo and

135
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
tutorial. Uh, just let me know in the

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
comment section. Uh, Gum Loop is a lot

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,520
like NADN, but there are some more guard

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
rails. Um, so you know, the example they

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
use on their website, you can scrape a

140
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
website, scrape a website, you can ask

141
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
AI, and then you can write it into a

142
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
Google Sheets. So, uh, it's a lot like

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,560
NAN, but there's it's just a the it's

144
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,880
more user friendly. Um, and, uh, yeah,

145
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,680
that's Gum Loop. Um, I also did an

146
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,520
episode with Flo from

147
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,280
lindy.ai. Uh, in a lot of ways, it's

148
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,759
similar to Gum Loop. Um, it's it's

149
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,639
basically like an NAN agent platform

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,319
that allows you to, uh, basically

151
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,720
automate a bunch of stuff. So, uh, if

152
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,000
you haven't checked out the, um, the

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,680
episode with Flo, um, you know, we we

154
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
kind of went through how to automate,

155
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,639
uh, a a recruiter, how to do sales

156
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,400
prospecting, all automated, uh, all

157
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,720
using AI agents and not just one agent,

158
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
hundreds, or what they call agent

159
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,639
swarms, which is a key part of I

160
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,919
marketing. Quick break in the pod to

161
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,759
tell you a little bit about Startup

162
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,639
Empire. So, Startup Empire is my private

163
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,039
membership where it's a bunch of people

164
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,319
like me, like you who want to build out

165
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,639
their startup ideas. Now, they're

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,560
looking for content to help accelerate

167
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,160
that. They're looking for potential

168
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,639
co-founders. They're looking for uh

169
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,919
tutorials from people like me to come in

170
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,440
and tell them, "How do you do email

171
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,199
marketing? How do you build an audience?

172
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,960
How do you go viral on Twitter?" All

173
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,120
these different things. That's exactly

174
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
what Startup Empire is. And it's for

175
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
people who want to start a startup but

176
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,560
are looking for ideas or it's for people

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,800
who have a startup but just they're not

178
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,440
seeing the traction uh that they need.

179
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,360
So you can check out the link to

180
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,280
startupmpire.co in the description. Uh

181
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,520
Manis, I've done an episode on Manis

182
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
before. Um, in fact, you know, I

183
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
actually threw this presentation into

184
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,840
Manis to help design and and help me

185
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
think through it. So, the fact that I

186
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,599
can do that is, you know, it's kind of

187
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,680
meta, but that's vibe marketing, right?

188
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
You know, I I put it in here and it

189
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
helps me kind of think through what I

190
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,360
need to put in here. You know, it's a

191
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
designer, it's a strategist, it's a

192
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,360
McKenzie level analyst. Uh, so highly

193
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,919
recommend playing with that. And then of

194
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,080
course um Claude or Clude as I say uh

195
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,800
you can definitely use it to uh you know

196
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
write. It's probably one of the best

197
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,440
writing tools out there right now. Open

198
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,400
router um you know people know this a

199
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,319
bit less uh but it's basically a way to

200
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,680
get one single AI key that helps manage

201
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,120
multiple multiple models. So, um, you

202
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
know, if you're creating, you know, if

203
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
if you want to use DeepSseek R1 for this

204
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,319
and open AAI 03 for that, uh, using

205
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,080
something like open router is something

206
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,800
that you're going to want to play around

207
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,800
with. Sora, I've done episodes on this

208
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,159
before. Well, chat GBT image den uh you

209
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,760
know one of the interesting things that

210
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,479
Jacob Posel said on on on the tuto on

211
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,200
one of our tutorials uh on on on the

212
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
channel was that he actually thinks that

213
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
Sora is you know you get better results

214
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
on Sora than you do on chat GBT image

215
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,600
gen. But this idea that you can go into

216
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
a Sora or Chat GBT image gen and

217
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,680
generate these extremely high quality uh

218
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,959
photos, videos um and content. I mean,

219
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,959
how doesn't that change the game in

220
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,959
social, right? Like, how, you know, it

221
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,040
it helps arm you with this huge uh

222
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
advantage, unfair advantage to actually

223
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
go and create content that's going to

224
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
resonate with your audience. So, this is

225
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
something um that my co-founder, Boring

226
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,600
Marketing, put together uh for for his

227
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
holding company, and I think it's one of

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
those things that I think uh everyone

229
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,160
should basically do. Um, it's a

230
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
scorecard. Um, and the reason I put it

231
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
in here is it's a scorecard of all the

232
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
different models. You can see 40 mini,

233
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,360
03 mini, gro 3, uh, code 3.7, deepsee

234
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,440
reasoner, perplexity, sonar, deep

235
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,160
research. And it basically scores it by

236
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,480
analyst brief blog. And the point of

237
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,279
this is that

238
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,279
uh certain models are going to be better

239
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,360
for certain things for whatever it is

240
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
you're doing within Vibe Marketing.

241
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,200
though you know I talked about you know

242
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
when it comes to uh you know writing for

243
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,640
example blog creation you can see at the

244
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,920
bottom here uh you know code 3.7 it's

245
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,000
actually amazing for content brief and

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,519
blog creation so you know well-crafted

247
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,360
blog with humanlike content it

248
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,120
understands brand voice and maintains

249
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
consistency and adds relevant internal

250
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
links when we add it for when when we uh

251
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,320
when we add website for it to refer to

252
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,480
now you have to figure out uh for

253
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
yourself which which models and which

254
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,680
LLMs are going to be your LLM marketing

255
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,120
friends. Some things are going to be

256
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,480
better, some things are going to be

257
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,079
worse, and I encourage people to

258
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,000
actually go and create scorecards so

259
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,399
that they know uh what's working uh for

260
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,880
them. I will say as a caveat that these

261
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
models are changing all the time. I've

262
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,480
noticed actually over the last couple

263
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
weeks that uh code 37 is actually kind

264
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
of getting worse at writing. So uh you

265
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,320
know, you got to continue update this.

266
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
So, the moment you've all been waiting

267
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,959
for. Let's actually see some workflows

268
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,519
so we can learn how you can copy uh Vibe

269
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,160
Marketing Pros and and start automating

270
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,760
you and just sort, you know, you can lay

271
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,079
on the beach while this this weird, you

272
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,120
know, robot thing is going to serve you

273
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,680
cash. Let's talk about

274
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,160
um basically a few workflows here. So,

275
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
uh, for your stack on this, uh, you're

276
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,560
going to want N8 to N. You're going to

277
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,920
want a Google Sheets, you're going to

278
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,760
need an AI model, you're going to need

279
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
Google Cloud Console, you're going to

280
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,079
need, um, some data sources, so social

281
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,839
platforms or other inputs, and you're

282
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,360
going to need open router, which we

283
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,880
talked about before. It's basically

284
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
access multiple AI models through one

285
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
API. Now, once you have that stack,

286
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
you're going to be able to create a few

287
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
different workflows. You'll be able to

288
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,079
create a data analyzer, so you can

289
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,800
connect sheets with AI for insights.

290
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,160
You'll be able to create a content

291
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
monitor. You can scrape Reddit and

292
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
summarize with AI. You can create a

293
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,399
competitor alert, get notifications of

294
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,519
competitor posts, email

295
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,880
summarizer, weekly AI summaries of

296
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,640
emails. You can even do a meeting

297
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,040
assistant, although this exists uh a a

298
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,480
lot, you know, in other products.

299
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,720
Um but uh yeah basically the formula is

300
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,800
you pull data from sources, you

301
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
transform it with AI, you analyze the

302
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
results, you apply insights to strategy,

303
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,800
and you create a closed loop uh strategy

304
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,120
with output. So this is just some really

305
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
really simple ways to actually create

306
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
some of your first workflows. We're

307
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
going to get to more interesting stuff

308
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,160
um over here. So Jordan Mix, who uh is a

309
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
partner at Late Checkout, my holding

310
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
company, uh who has been on the pod

311
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,720
before, had this really cool thing where

312
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,519
um his workflow was the one-click CRM.

313
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,920
So he basically uh was able to um you

314
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
know, you can think of the use case of

315
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,000
this podcast, the Startup Ideas podcast,

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
every single week having a uh here's the

317
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,160
five guests that we should invite on the

318
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,639
podcast. uh automated uh and it's and

319
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,120
and vetted and reaching out based on

320
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
their social links basing based on other

321
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,880
content that they've done. So, how does

322
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,360
it work? You uh step one is you trigger

323
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
with Gum Loop browser extension. Um and

324
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,880
you can check that out on your own time,

325
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,079
but um the browser extension basically

326
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,720
uh you know what, I can show it to you

327
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,519
real quick. It's this Chrome extension

328
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,920
that automates your browser with AI. So

329
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,519
basically, you can record your browser

330
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,600
actions and replay them with a single

331
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
click. No coding required. You can

332
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,560
scrape and process web content with AI.

333
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,880
Um, so super helpful. It's a Chrome

334
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
extension, by the way. I'm not

335
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,480
affiliated with Gum Loop or uh yeah, I'm

336
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,639
not affiliated with with this company at

337
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,200
all. Uh, and let's go back to the

338
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
presentation.

339
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
Yeah, someone asked me, "Are you filming

340
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,639
with Gum Loop?" No, no, I just I'm

341
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,160
trying to give you the sauce. I want to

342
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,800
see what you can create. Um, and,

343
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,839
uh, let's, uh, let's continue. So, uh,

344
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,440
you trigger with the Gum Loop browser

345
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
extension. You scrape the website so you

346
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
can get a transcript, for example, if

347
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,360
it's a YouTube video. Then you can

348
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,320
analyze the content and web search. Um,

349
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,079
you can extract the data. You get the

350
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,920
social links and other relevant links.

351
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,440
And then you can craft an outreach

352
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,079
message, store it in Air Table, and then

353
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,600
you can send a weekly summary to your

354
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,959
team. Now, you actually don't even need

355
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,480
to use Gum Loop for that. You can use

356
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,519
Lindy, you can use other platforms. Um,

357
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,600
but this is super cool because it does a

358
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
lot of the heavy lifting, the boring

359
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,279
stuff uh around actually figuring out

360
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,199
who to reach out to and and how to reach

361
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,040
out to

362
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,120
them. Uh, this is a classic Vibe

363
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,720
Marketing uh example. Uh we I did a

364
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,839
podcast on this how we basically built

365
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,320
this Disney Pixar level videos of myself

366
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,399
um using Chat GBT uh Leonardo Chat GBT

367
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,519
was on the script writing I think

368
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,639
Leonardo AI cling AI uh stitching that

369
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,240
together to actually make these

370
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,440
beautiful images move into videos and 11

371
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,800
labs for um for the voice and uh highly

372
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,079
recommend to watch this. It's pretty

373
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,320
long, but um it's an interesting way

374
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
because you know why is this interesting

375
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,480
in in the context of Vibe marketing?

376
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,959
Because if you can create there's this

377
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,800
arbitrage moment that exists right now

378
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,880
where you can actually go and create

379
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,199
Pixar level content that's going to fly

380
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,839
on social media if it's actually good uh

381
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,800
and your competitors are

382
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,040
not. Uh you can even create a completely

383
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,560
AIdriven newsletter. So you use Google

384
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,399
appcript that takes a topic and a point

385
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,639
of view from a Google sheet and then and

386
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,639
then uses perplexity for all the deep

387
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,199
research uh code for writing and

388
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,440
midjourney for images. Imagine that like

389
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,839
a completely AIdriven newsletter. Now, I

390
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,839
know some people in the comment section

391
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,759
are going to be like, "Oh my god, that's

392
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,440
just going to be AI slop." And it might

393
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,160
it might be AI slop, but if you have the

394
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,120
right prompts um and you're Yeah, you

395
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,959
have the right prompts and you do have

396
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,000
some human in the loop at some point. Um

397
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,720
it it you know, I I wouldn't say that's

398
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,600
it's 100% true. I've seen AIdriven

399
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
newsletters that are so so valuable and

400
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,240
I love getting in my inbox and you you

401
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,759
probably didn't wouldn't even know that

402
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,199
it's uh

403
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,920
AI. Um okay, so how to scale content

404
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
with Vibe Marketing. Couple tools that

405
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,199
we're we're using NAN, Google Sheets,

406
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,440
Open Router, Open AAI, and Clo37. So how

407
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,759
it works, you get insight from specific

408
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,240
subreddits. You come up with content

409
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,720
ideas using open AI. You store the

410
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,920
ideas. You get one idea per execution

411
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,560
and then you use code point uh 3.7 to

412
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
create content for LinkedIn, YouTube

413
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
video scripts and blog post. Shout out

414
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
to boring marketer who put this

415
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,000
together. Um I just think it's

416
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
brilliant, right? Reddit, you have all

417
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,839
these validated ideas and then you use

418
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,359
open AI to sort of remix it and

419
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,280
brainstorm. Um it's just it helps. You

420
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,119
know so many people come to me and said

421
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,880
say I you know I don't have time to do

422
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,959
content I can't do content ideas I need

423
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,599
a system for creating content this is

424
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,039
your system vibe marketing is here sales

425
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,919
agent you can create a you know use an

426
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,039
LLM to validate a raw list of leads then

427
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,080
get info from that website analyze it

428
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,919
generate a report and send custom

429
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,120
outreach you don't need a junior

430
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,720
salesperson literally just automate it

431
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,480
using Vibe marketing

432
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,240
e-commerce, a system that takes Amazon

433
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,320
as that's like basically the Amazon

434
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,360
skew, uh, and runs it through seven AI

435
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,760
agents, pulls in reviews, keywords,

436
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,600
search behavior, turns it into a full

437
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
listing, bullets, titles, back-end

438
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,400
terms, image overlay copy, even A+

439
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,880
content, all structured, all conversion

440
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
focused. It's basically like having a

441
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
strategist, copywriter, and SEO person

442
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,120
in one click. Are you getting fired up

443
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,960
about Vibe marketing? I am just talking

444
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,080
about it and it goes on and on you know

445
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,280
um you can you could uh here's another

446
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,880
content idea content one uh using NAN

447
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,440
search reddit for relevant combos in my

448
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,600
niche you know how much I like Reddit ex

449
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,840
extract themes painoints for content

450
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,320
ideas and then generate psychologically

451
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,480
powerful hooks outlines and briefs and

452
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,840
just store it in a Google sheet for

453
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,360
editing so it's similar to what we saw

454
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,840
before um but thinking you maybe you

455
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,360
just do it for hooks maybe you just do

456
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,480
it for outines Maybe you just do it for

457
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,720
briefs. Um, so this one is about, you

458
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
know, who, you know, people who want to

459
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,240
start YouTube channels but need content

460
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,160
ideas. So first, you know, you're going

461
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,039
to use again NAN, YouTube API, Open AI,

462
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,640
Open Router, Google Sheets, Google

463
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,039
Cloud. How you do it? Step one is you

464
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,360
find videos. So you search YouTube for a

465
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,440
keyword and fetch trending videos in

466
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,880
your niche. Uh, then you extract the

467
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,960
info, get title, description, views, and

468
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,120
channel details. Then you store the raw

469
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,039
data. You save that video into Google

470
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,080
Sheets. Analyze the content. Use AI to

471
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
extract content angles from titles and

472
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,120
descriptions. Generate ideas. Ask idea.

473
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,000
Ask AI to suggest new video ideas based

474
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,559
on those angles. And by the way, use the

475
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,039
model that you know will come will come

476
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,880
up with the best stuff here. And then

477
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
store the results. So save those angles

478
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,679
in Google Sheets all in the cloud. I

479
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,440
don't you know those are just a few of

480
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,120
the workflows I encourage people to go

481
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,039
and try and come up with their own. Use

482
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,559
any tool you'd like. Uh this is where um

483
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
you know I I think that the world of

484
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
marketing is going to is really going to

485
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,840
change over the next 12 to 18 months.

486
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,400
This is an image from from my co-founder

487
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,880
um where you know he said you know he

488
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,679
says basically marketers using AI tools

489
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,000
in isolated ways for specific outputs on

490
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
individual channels. That's how people

491
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,760
work today. But basically in the next 12

492
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,440
to 18 months, we're going to see an

493
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
interconnected AI system working

494
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
together with shared contexts. You're

495
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,400
going to have basically uh multiple AI

496
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,160
agents and workflows. And these are

497
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,320
going to be managed by manager agents

498
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
trained by human experts. This is the

499
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,320
future of marketing. Everyone marketers

500
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,880
will evolve from individual ex uh

501
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,280
executors to orchestrator of these

502
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,760
systems. Small marketing teams of five

503
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,679
will accomplish what previously required

504
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,919
much larger teams. We talked about that.

505
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,480
Adding new marketing channels isn't a,

506
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
you know, won't require hiring. It's

507
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,120
literally just an agent away. Outputs

508
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,000
will be more consistent and with less

509
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,400
feedback cycles needed and systems will

510
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,320
be goal oriented. So, it's going to be

511
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,919
about telling your agents, hey man, I

512
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,159
need 50,000 new organic visitors

513
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,240
monthly. Go figure out how to do it.

514
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,919
There's going to be real time

515
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,919
adaptation. So, real-time adaptation

516
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,760
will occur as systems analyze market

517
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,240
gaps, create opportunities instantly.

518
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
marketing might resemble high frequency

519
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,720
trading. We talked about that. Um, you

520
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,799
get the idea. Marketing is changing so

521
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,960
much right now and now is the time to

522
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,000
actually get good at this vibe marketing

523
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,440
stuff. So, what makes a good vibe

524
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
marketer? I think that if you can think

525
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,840
in systems, not campaigns, creating

526
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,919
these like systems, these flowcharts

527
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,120
type things, you'll outperform. If

528
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,760
you're good at testing relentlessly, you

529
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,440
know, now you're no longer testing two

530
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,679
ads. you're testing 50 variations, 100

531
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,120
variations. You're doing a lot of

532
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,280
testing every single day. Uh, and you're

533
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,520
learning quick. Um, you're frontloading

534
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,440
value in everything you create. You

535
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
know, you build once, you distribute

536
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,360
forever, and you let machines handle the

537
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,480
boring stuff. By the way, if you want to

538
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,039
see more Vibe Marketing tutorials,

539
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,120

541
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,440

548
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,039
marketers and uh I think he charges 100

549
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,640
bucks

550
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,880
lifetime to join but the price goes up

551
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,280
every 100 members. So, for for people

552
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,480
interested, check it out. Um, that's the

553
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,159
introduction to VI marketing. I hope

554
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,600
that was helpful. I wanted to give you

555
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,080
all the sauce. Didn't want to hold back.

556
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
Um, if you enjoyed this thing, I think

557
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,799
you you kind of you got to let me know

558
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,960
at least. So, like, comment, and sub,

559
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,799
and share this with a friend so you can

560
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,480
go actually build something. I don't

561
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,919
want you just to like, comment, and

562
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,840
subscribe. That's not fun. I want you to

563
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,400
build something, and I want to see you

564
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,799
win. I'm rooting for you. The best thing

565
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,679
you can do uh is to actually just play

566
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,320
with the tools. Uh see what you learn.

567
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,400
Put it in your schedule. Every day I'm

568
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,919
going to spend 30 minutes on this. I'm

569
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,039
going to create a workflow. I'm going to

570
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,039
automate this. I'm going to ask my team

571
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,000
what are what are repetitive tasks that

572
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
I can go and automate. Honestly, that's

573
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,480
the best thing you can do. Um and that

574
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,000
doesn't cost you any money. So, um a lot
