1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,960
What if you can automate your marketing

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,240
team with AI agents and just have

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,120
content on autopilot? I know it sounds

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,800
like it's out of the future, and I was

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,240
skeptical, too. But I had Mr. Vibe

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,880
Marketing on the pot again to break down

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,240
and share his entire NAND workflow with

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,680
how to create content on autopilot that

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,960
actually gets likes and comments. So,

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,199
uh, you know, in this episode, he gives

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,760
away all the sauce. Um, then at the end,

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,399
he actually gives away, uh, all his

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,640
prompts and his template for doing it.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,600
God bless him. Uh, like this video right

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
now on YouTube. Comment because this is,

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
uh, an incredible episode where you'll

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,399
learn how to become a vibe marketer and

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,640
start automating and running your

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,199
business on autopilot. Enjoy the

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,199
episode.

21
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,239
It'spping time, baby.

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,119
We got the boring marketer, Mr. Vibe

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,520
Marketing, back on the podcast. He's

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,400
going to teach us a workflow today. What

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
are we going to learn? Uh, today we're

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,680
going to learn some basics of how to use

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,920
inadin. We're going to find some data

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,560
around a niche or a topic. We're going

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,040
to feed that into some really smart LLMs

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,400
and then we're going to produce some

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,799
content and even automatically publish

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,479
it on a platform. So, you're going to

33
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,479
see an endto-end automation that

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,000
hopefully is going to save you somewhere

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,479
around 10 to 15 hours a week. And is it

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,159
really going to save me 10 to 15 hours a

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,640
week or you just saying that it's saving

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
me time? So, in this use case, I'm going

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,759
to show you a LinkedIn workflow. I spend

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
most of my time on X and I actually hate

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,600
creating content for LinkedIn. So, uh,

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
you know, as much as I can use AI to

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
help me with that process, I I try to do

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
that. And, uh, we'll see. We'll see how

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,119
it works. Okay. And if I actually use

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,520
this workflow, what is the potential

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,360
outcome of that? Like, why why do why

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,160
should I I even care about this? Yeah,

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
the outcome is that you're going to be

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,879
able to test content angles, hooks, and

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,680
topics way faster. So instead of like

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
going getting a subpar result just from

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,560
opening up Claude or Chat GPT, this is

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,319
going to get a lot of context, a lot of

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,720
information, and it's going to create

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
top performing content based off of

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,400
that. It's even going to create an image

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,800
for you, and it's going to post

59
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,599
automatically. Now, often times AI isn't

60
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,680
quite there to just push a button and go

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,000
end to end and post for you. Uh, I

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,920
recommend doing that to test things out.

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,360
I've heard you talk about this a little

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,879
bit, too. Sometimes you'll throw out a

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,959
tweet, you'll see if it catches or

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,120
you'll even use like maybe a secret

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
account and then you'll delete it. So

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
I'll do the same thing. I've been doing

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,640
that actually for the past couple hours

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,879
on LinkedIn. So you'll be able to test,

71
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,200
you'll be able to refine, but I threw in

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,840
a step here so that if you want, you can

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,239
uh actually edit the content before you

74
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,080
before you put it live as well. All

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
right, let's rock. All right, so I have

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,280
this colorcoded here so that we can

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,760
separate this out in stages. And again,

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,280
I want to try to give people some

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
actionable tips so that they can go and

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,319
build a workflow. And I'm also going to

81
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,120
give away the code for this workflow so

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
that people can go and download it after

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
they watch the show. They can upload it

84
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,440
into inate and have a really nice

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
starting template to go and make their

86
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,560
own. So, uh, let's dig right in.

87
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,280
So basically what I have here is a whole

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,000
area that's going to analyze YouTube and

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
X for different topics. So what I will

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,080
do is open up a chat down at the bottom

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
of the screen here if you see that. And

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,519
all I need to do actually is I just need

93
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,159
to enter in a topic. So we're talking

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,319
about inadin today. I post some content

95
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,080
on that as well. So let's just put in.

96
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,519
So, it takes that keyword essentially

97
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,599
and now what it's doing is it's going

98
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,879
over to YouTube and it's scraping the

99
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,080
top videos on YouTube for my topic. So,

100
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,399
it's going out there and finding, you

101
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,880
know, 20 to 30 videos that have a high

102
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,358
degree of engagement. It's also doing

103
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,919
the same thing on X. It's actually going

104
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,479
to my account. It's looking for posts

105
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,840
around workflow automation and AI. So

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,880
right now it's uh it's processing this

107
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,680
and what it's going to do after it finds

108
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,360
YouTube videos and posts on X about NADN

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,320
is it's going to actually watch all the

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,040
videos and transcribe those for me. So

111
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,960
I'm going to have all the content from

112
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,840
the top YouTube videos around NAN and

113
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,040
then I'm going to have a number of

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
topics from X as well. And you're using

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,320
Appify, right? I'm using Appify. Yeah.

116
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
So Appify uh is an awesome platform.

117
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,759
Basically, if you want to go and scrape

118
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
anything on the internet, you want to

119
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,919
scrape Instagram, you want to scrape

120
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,440
Amazon, you want to scrape Tik Tok, you

121
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,560
want to scrape YouTube or X, uh they

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,840
have like open sort of APIs that you can

123
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,919
access within Appify and plug them into

124
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,600
your workflow to go and process that

125
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,759
data. So that's what these HTTP requests

126
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,440
are. Basically, they're just calling

127
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,039
that ampify API. Uh, and in this one, I

128
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,280
picked a YouTube one and have a couple

129
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
instructions in there. And then this

130
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,479
one, I have one for X as well. Okay, so

131
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,320
it's scraping right now. And then what

132
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
it's going to do is it's going to put

133
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,039
all this data together in essentially

134
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,280
one big text block. So, it's going to

135
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
have a bunch of transcribed YouTube

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,759
videos with the hooks, the titles, the

137
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,440
content, and it's going to have some

138
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
exposts as well. So, it's going to bring

139
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
all those together and merge them into

140
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,680
basically one big block of

141
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,199
text. So, this is kind of my research

142
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,280
phase here. I'm just kind of going out

143
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
and I'm making sure I have enough

144
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,560
context to go and feed my LLMs in the

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,680
next step. So, whatever niche go ahead,

146
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
which by the way, this is the step that

147
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,560
any savvy content creator is going to

148
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
take when they're creating content,

149
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
right? They're they're going to see what

150
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,639
else is out there. uh how are people

151
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,440
positioning it and where's my

152
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,199
opportunity?

153
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,039
Yeah, that's right. And you know to do

154
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,960
this research manually like you would

155
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,080
have to spend like 24/7 online uh if you

156
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,160
want to unplug and actually have a life

157
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,919
it makes sense to have like robots and

158
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,960
AI doing this stuff for you. So yeah, I

159
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,639
mean like instead of you know starting

160
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,120
from scratch or or whatever, go and find

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,520
things that are already performing and

162
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,039
you know doing that for content that's

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,720
similar to doing things like trying to

164
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
create a startup idea or something like

165
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
that too. You know you want to find

166
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,880
things that are already working so you

167
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
can sort of sort of shortcut that and

168
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,800
take those learnings and make it your

169
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
own. Okay. So after we get uh all of

170
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,360
this data from YouTube and X, we're

171
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,720
going to do another step here. So, we've

172
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,199
got this big block of text that includes

173
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
all that video information and stuff.

174
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,919
And now I have an agent, and this is a

175
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,360
content idea generator, and it plugs

176
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
into an open AI LLM. And what it's going

177
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,240
to do is it's going to go and look at

178
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,400
that big block of text. It's doing it

179
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,240
right now, and it's going to scan

180
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,919
through there, and it's going to find

181
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,360
fresh angles and content ideas for us,

182
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,759
uh, that aren't just replicating what we

183
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
researched. So, I don't want to go and

184
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,759
just like copy people's content. I just

185
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,840
want to use that as inspiration and then

186
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,759
come up with my own ideas. So, that's

187
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,160
what this step right here is doing. And

188
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
when you say come up with your own

189
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,440
ideas, you mean AI coming up with the

190
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,160
ideas for you. Yeah, that's right. So,

191
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,520
in here, that's right. To be clear, you

192
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,039
don't want to do anything. You want to

193
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,000
set up the workflow. Yes. And hang out

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
on the beach. In true Vibe Marketer

195
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
fashion, that's exactly what I'm doing.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
Yeah. So, I have a prompt in here. I'm

197
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,319
just saying like using all of this

198
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,039
content that I'm giving you, create a

199
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,599
list of actionable content ideas that

200
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,000
are strictly related to marketing. So,

201
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
if you remember my my keyword that I

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
entered in the chat was inate. Now, that

203
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
could include a lot of stuff. It could

204
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,160
include things on like automating email

205
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,960
replies or sales tasks or whatever. So,

206
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,639
I want to look at those, but then I want

207
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,599
to extract ideas for marketing for how I

208
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,279
can kind of repurpose that and come up

209
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,440
with some fresh

210
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,080
angles. So, here um you know, for a

211
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
title, I want it to be short and clear

212
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,320
when it comes up with a content idea. I

213
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,480
want to have a scroll stopping idea for

214
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,519
my hook to pull people in. And then, um

215
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,600
I want it to suggest like the optimal

216
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
format for this content. And then it

217
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
needs to come up with an angle as well.

218
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,600
So it needs to have like a unique point

219
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,160
of view around how marketers can scale

220
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
their efforts using AI and leveraging

221
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,000
NAD uh for their

222
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,880
workflows. Um few other instructions. So

223
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,279
avoid like too much technical jargon and

224
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,279
technical topics. I'm kind of framing

225
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,399
like who this content is for uh for the

226
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,399
AI to come up with some ideas for my

227
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,200
audience specifically. and uh you know

228
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,519
it's kind of going through and it's also

229
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,200
looking at sort of my top performing

230
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
exposts so that it can identify how I'm

231
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,320
talking uh what sort of themes I'm using

232
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
and stuff like that. So combining all

233
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
this is going to give us a really

234
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,560
powerful data set to go and create the

235
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,040
right type of content for my audience.

236
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,920
And did you come up with this yourself?

237
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,800
Yeah, like all these prompts and stuff.

238
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,959
Yeah. Yeah. So, I'll come up with like,

239
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,880
you know, an initial prompt and then

240
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
I'll take it and I'll go over to like

241
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,200
chat GPT or Manis or Claude and I'll

242
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,279
say, "Hey, improve this prompt. Here's

243
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
what I want to achieve." And then I'll

244
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,600
place in like some examples of content

245
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
that I want this entire workflow to kind

246
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,880
of create. So, this goes back to like,

247
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,959
you know, two two things that I always

248
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,720
talk about with AI. It's like know what

249
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,240
questions to ask and know what good

250
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,080
looks like. So if you have sort of a

251
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,640
baseline prompt, you can go and use AI

252
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,720
to improve your prompt, which is a step

253
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
that I often use for all of these

254
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,040
different types of agent nodes. Here it

255
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
did that. Looks like it uh came up with

256
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,279
the ideas in the background. And then

257
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,360
once I have the ideas, you know,

258
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,839
something that often resonates on social

259
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,880
is having some specific like facts,

260
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
trends, and sources to back up the

261
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,560
claims. I also don't want the model to

262
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
completely like hallucinate and just

263
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,800
come up with like random stuff that

264
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,519
doesn't make any sense. So in this step,

265
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,399
I have a research agent and I'm using

266
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,680
perplexity here to go out and find some

267
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
use cases that people have actually

268
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,480
talked about with some real stats. I'm

269
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,720
identifying some trends and insights,

270
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,279
marketing use cases, ideas that are

271
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,680
happening in the industry, stats,

272
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
frameworks or case studies that we can

273
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,160
reference, popular opinions. So, I'm

274
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,720
just getting as much data as I can

275
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,560
around these marketing angles with

276
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
workflow automation and AI so that I can

277
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,760
feed them into my content agent. Makes

278
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,560
sense. I mean, I I I'm

279
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,240
just so excited to see what the output

280
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
is going to be. Like if this actually

281
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,920
could do what it says it could do, then

282
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,959
this is like a billiondoll workflow.

283
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
Yeah. And there's also some startup like

284
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
concepts we can talk around about this

285
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,880
for how to like leverage it to create

286
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,200
businesses. I think that this is like an

287
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
interesting backbone to like you know

288
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,760
power a consulting business or a

289
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,480
freelancing business or really optimize

290
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
you know agency operations or something

291
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,279
like that as well. All right. So uh one

292
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
note here on the research agent another

293
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,399
helpful tool to call out is open router.

294
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,000
So often times in a workflow I try to

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,120
use the best LLM or the best model for

296
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,480
each specific task. So for research I've

297
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,880
got like you know uh perplexity right

298
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,600
here. I've got open AI over here. I've

299
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,360
got Claude over here later in the

300
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
workflow that we'll look at. But open

301
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,839
router allows me to access all of these

302
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,200
models with one node. So if you open it

303
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
up, you can see that I've got perplexity

304
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,639
sonar uh selected here. But if I wanted

305
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,440
to use any other model, you can just

306
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,760
select them from this interface rather

307
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,000
than going to like clawed and getting an

308
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,880
API key or perplexity and getting an

309
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
open or and getting a an API key. This

310
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,440
makes it a lot easier to integrate these

311
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,959
models when you actually build these

312
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,519
things out. And it's one price, right?

313
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,240
Yeah, one price. Uh here it is. It's

314
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,839
just, you know, one thing that you

315
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
subscribe to and then you can access all

316
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,360
the different models in a really easy to

317
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,600
use way. And and just to be clear, we're

318
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,399
not involved in Appify, Open Router,

319
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,399
NADN. We're just showing you how to use

320
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,760
the tools. Yep. Yep. So after it sort of

321
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,839
identifies the ideas and it does the

322
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,600
research, it's going to sort of like

323
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,480
merge those together again and then it's

324
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,839
going to feed it into a LinkedIn content

325
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,240
agent. Now you can replicate this for

326
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,639
basically any channel, but since I

327
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,079
struggle with LinkedIn and I've been

328
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,680
trying to figure it out, uh we're going

329
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,079
to talk about LinkedIn today. So I have

330
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,040
this agent node here again and uh when I

331
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,079
create content I like to use Claude 3.7

332
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,560
Sonnet. You probably have used that as

333
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
well. It's the best writing right now as

334
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,160
of recording this is the best writing

335
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,360
LLM that exists. Exactly. Exactly. And

336
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,839
Claude when you give it the context and

337
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,399
the data it's so powerful. Like if if

338
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,200
you arm it with enough context it can

339
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,480
come up with some pretty incredible

340
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,639
things. Yeah. I think the, you know, the

341
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,040
problem is people don't give it enough

342
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,560
context and then they're like, "This is

343
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,440
garbage." Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Most

344
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,120
people, you know, they're opening up

345
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,360
Claude or something like that, they're

346
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
entering in a prompt, and then it spits

347
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,240
something out, and they're like, "Ah, I

348
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,839
don't like this." Well, you know, you're

349
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,920
not going and scraping like all the top

350
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,240
performing YouTube videos, tweets,

351
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,079
analyzing your own account for brand

352
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,000
voice and stuff like that, and then

353
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,079
feeding it into the model. So, you

354
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,160
really need to, you know, power it with

355
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
tons of data and tons of context to get

356
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,720
the most out of it. So, a few little

357
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,800
prompting tips that I have in the in the

358
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
LinkedIn post agent here. Um, I'm

359
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,519
including a brand voice. So, you know,

360
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,000
AI uses a lot of fluff. It might still

361
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,519
use a little bit of fluff at the end

362
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,279
here, but I'm trying my best to give it

363
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,199
some guard rails. Uh, write with

364
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,160
authentic expertise and direct

365
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,480
communication. Uh, be confident and

366
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,760
straightforward. Don't be overly formal

367
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,000
or academic. speak directly to the

368
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,120
reader, avoid like corporate jargon and

369
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,199
marketing speak, you know, a bunch of

370
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,480
stuff like that. And I've just sort of

371
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720
like through trial and error, you know,

372
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,399
listed these different sort of brand

373
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,160
guidelines out. Um, and then a few other

374
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,560
things. Um, it's taking the research

375
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
here. This is that JSON output which is

376
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,040
basically just a big block of of text

377
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,839
all the context that I have created and

378
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,440
create a narrative- driven post that

379
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,760
gives readers actionable insights and

380
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
takeaways that will impact their

381
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,320
business in positive ways. And then only

382
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,279
use data if it's relevant and don't pick

383
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,519
topics around like AI marketing tools

384
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,839
blindly like make sure it's tied to the

385
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,920
context of what we're talking about. All

386
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,320
right. So, another thing that AI always

387
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
does, it always wants to add hashtags

388
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,040
and emojis. So, I make sure to like

389
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,880
include the instructions like don't use

390
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,199
hashtags, um, you know, things like that

391
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,680
in here. And then I give it a format for

392
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,720
how I want the output to be. So, title,

393
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,800
uh, content, uh, things of that nature.

394
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,959
And then if you look down at the bottom,

395
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,720
I've got more instructions where I'm

396
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
kind of framing the LLM here. So, you're

397
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,199
a LinkedIn content strategist and

398
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,320
conversion copywriter. I always include

399
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
something around like direct response or

400
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,440
conversion uh copywriting when I'm using

401
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,240
AI to create content. Otherwise, it

402
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,800
creates sort of like kind of brand fluff

403
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,199
type stuff. And I really want it to like

404
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,959
lead people through a journey. I wanted

405
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,320
to have a strong hook. I want it to

406
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,959
build interest, desire, give some

407
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,279
actionable value, and then maybe a clear

408
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,000
call to action at the end. Good tip.

409
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,480
Yep. I would also say you didn't include

410
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,959
it, but what are those dashes that uh AI

411
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,399
always puts? M dashes. M dashes. I would

412
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,120
say like don't have any M dashes. Yes. M

413
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,440
dash overload on the internet right now.

414
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,880
And like when people see that, they know

415
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,519
it's AI, too. Exactly. And that's a

416
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,560
turnoff, right? Big time. Yeah. Yeah.

417
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,959
Yeah. Big- time turnoff. Um you know,

418
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,720
you want to make it feel as authentic as

419
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,279
possible. And sometimes AI does a pretty

420
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,040
good job. Other times you need to get in

421
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,959
there and edit a little bit. Uh which

422
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,519
we'll we'll get to as well. So yeah,

423
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,120
just some more instructions like some

424
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,599
writing guidelines and things like that.

425
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,400
Um you know, often when I'm trying to

426
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
create prompts for content, I'll like

427
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
look at some of your content, how you

428
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,319
write. I'll I'll feed in some stuff that

429
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,839
I've created and some other creators

430
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
that I really like. And uh you know,

431
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,439
especially when it comes to like B2B

432
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,599
content, um you know, you need to be

433
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,119
more like a creator. That's really kind

434
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,160
of the future there. All right, so let's

435
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,799
get out of that. And um so it's created

436
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,160
our LinkedIn post and it's put it into a

437
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,440
Google doc here that you can see. Okay.

438
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,840
And then we're working on creating an

439
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,039
image uh for our post as well. So this

440
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,559
uses the OpenAI image gen model uh that

441
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,919
I'm sure everyone has tested. And you

442
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,880
can do crazy things like dynamic prompts

443
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,440
depending on, you know, the topic of the

444
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,679
post and stuff like that. But for our

445
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,000
purposes purposes today, I'm just

446
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,280
prompting it to create a 3D image

447
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,440
communicating an AI system or, you know,

448
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,760
something like that to keep it simple.

449
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,400
Okay. So, uh, right now we're in the

450
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,280
human in the loop step. So, you know, a

451
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,039
lot of people don't want to just

452
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
straight up publish content directly

453
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,280
from a model. Um, you know, sometimes

454
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,640
like we talked about, we're not quite

455
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,280
there yet. So, you know, I work in Slack

456
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,919
all the time. Um, most people that are

457
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,520
in, you know, startups and marketing

458
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
probably do. So, what's going to happen

459
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,679
at this stage is it's actually going to

460
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,200
send me a link to the Google doc in

461
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Slack. And I will just show you my Slack

462
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,640
because I think this is a pretty cool

463
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,360
step. All right. Yep. And there it is. I

464
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
have a Slack channel set up here where

465
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,679
I'm getting these triggers or these

466
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,799
Google Docs from Inaden. So, if you open

467
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,919
one up, uh, it sent me a draft and I'm

468
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,080
able to open up this completed post in a

469
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
Google doc. So, let's just go through it

470
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,559
a little bit. So, it says, "Three ways

471
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,480
to scale your marketing without hiring

472
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,559
another team." Pretty decent. Uh, sounds

473
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,679
actionable. And it's got kind of a

474
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,600
personal narrative here. So, I've spent

475
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,280
years juggling marketing tasks. that

476
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,200
could have been automated. Uh the

477
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,720
breaking point when my team missed

478
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,080
campaign deadlines because we're buried

479
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
in repetitive work that machines could

480
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,120
handle. Then I discovered inade and it

481
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,799
kind of goes through some different ways

482
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,720
that you can use it uh for your

483
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,799
marketing efforts. So here it's got

484
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,400
automate your content distribution

485
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,559
pipelines which funny enough that's what

486
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,559
we're talking about right now. Uh sort

487
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,360
of taking a topic and coming up with a

488
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
completed final post that is ready to

489
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,240
publish. You know, you know what really

490
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,480
works well on LinkedIn is photos of

491
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,039
yourself. So, I think that if I were to

492
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,200
do this workflow, what I would do, and

493
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
tell me if I can do this, create a

494
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,360
Google Drive folder with call it 50

495
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,919
pictures of myself in different poses.

496
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,799
You can even use AI to create some of

497
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:01,760
those. Um, and then just say pick a

498
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
random photo and attach it to the

499
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,640
content. Is that possible? Yeah, I think

500
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
it is. You know, when I was when I was

501
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,600
experimenting with this earlier, um I

502
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
was opening up my LinkedIn and this is

503
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,080
one that I actually published. Um if you

504
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,440
look at Slack, you can see this approve

505
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,280
button. And if I click that, this is

506
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,919
going to post right over to uh to my

507
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,520
link LinkedIn. So, um you know, this is

508
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
what happened when I did it earlier. It

509
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
created this post and then the image

510
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,760
generation created this image. Now, to

511
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,960
your point, um I think like a personal

512
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
photo would resonate a lot more. It

513
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
would feel more natural. It would feel

514
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,679
less AI. Um so, yeah, you could store

515
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,760
those in a Google Drive and you could

516
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,400
probably just have it randomly select uh

517
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,480
from that folder and pair it up with the

518
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,840
posts here. So, point is though, you

519
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
know, you can do all of this research.

520
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
You can get a highly relevant post. You

521
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,440
can even create the image. You can have

522
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,559
this fully formatted and in one button

523
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,480
uh you can you can publish directly to

524
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,039
whatever social platform you want. And

525
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,840
the most important point

526
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,640
is these are validated social posts.

527
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,400
These are not social posts that you have

528
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
no idea if they're going to get a like

529
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,720
or a comment because it's scraped

530
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,280
YouTube because it's scraped X and it's

531
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,760
got all that data. the chances of you

532
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,360
creating content that's going to

533
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,600
resonate with people is probably 10 or

534
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,480
50x. Yeah, absolutely. So, remove the

535
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,200
guess work, the guesswork and yeah, use

536
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,000
like real validation uh from things that

537
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,600
have already performed and then just

538
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
make it your own, you know, like you

539
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,960
don't have to guess and you can test

540
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
multiple of these to see which ones work

541
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
if you want. The ones that you don't

542
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,600
like, you can delete them. You can

543
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
double down on the ones to get some good

544
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,039
early data and then you can even, you

545
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,480
know, go and use it for other channels

546
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,720
as well. Anything else you wanted to

547
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,760
tell folks? Um, I thought this was kind

548
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,320
of funny. So, someone actually commented

549
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,280
like such a solid example and uh, you

550
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
know, they like the post and I was like,

551
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,280
now the question is, did a did AI write

552
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
it? So, I think that this passed the

553
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,679
touring test. So, pretty valuable uh,

554
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,080
little workflow here. Very cool. Um,

555
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,919
dude, always a pleasure having you on

556
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,840
the pod spilling the sauce. You could

557
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,520
have kept this to yourself, but you

558
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
didn't. uh you came on here and shared

559
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,960
it for free. So I appreciate that. I am

560
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,000
going to include where uh where to find

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
the boring marketer on X and YouTube for

562
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
more content like that. Um anything else

563
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,200
you want to plug? Yeah, one quick note.

564
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,720
Um so a lot of people need like a solid

565
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480
starter workflow that they can upload

566
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,320
into NAD without having to go through

567
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,000
the logic and trying to build all this

568
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,679
out. So I'm going to share a JSON file

569
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
that has this complete workflow. You can

570
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,760
download the file, you can upload it

571
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,919
into N in N8, you can make it your own

572
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,760
and start learning. Like the best way to

573
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,600
just get a handle on all this workflow

574
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,840
stuff is playing around with it,

575
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
tinkering, you know, seeing what kind of

576
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,360
output you get and then trying to

577
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,440
optimize it uh based on the data that

578
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
you're getting. So, uh we'll share the

579
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,280
link, but it's

585
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,280
free. We're just gonna give it away.

586
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
