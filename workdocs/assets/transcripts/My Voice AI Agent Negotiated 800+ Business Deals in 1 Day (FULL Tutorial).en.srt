1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
I brought in my main automation man's

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,799
Tony who works with SA Checkout. Tony,

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,720
what are we going to learn today? Uh,

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,719
I'm going to tell you the story of the

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,400
time that I made a voice AI that

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,480
lowballed every single luxury watch

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,960
dealer in the US for a Rolex Daytona.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,840
That's a $35,000 watch. And uh, it

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,760
actually kind of worked. Are you the

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,680
seller with the Rolex Daytona? Been

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
responding. Which Rolex Daytona? Which

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,640
Rolex Daytona do you have for sale?

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,679
Brand new box and papers. Got it. I love

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,000
it.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,280
What's your asking price for the

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,480
Daytona? 60,000.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,510
Boom. First actual offer.

18
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,320
[Music]

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,000
And why should people even care about

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
that? Um because I think people are

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
drastically underestimating what voice

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,559
AIs are capable of. Uh basically it's my

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,879
belief that any work that you do that's

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,280
over the phone could and may get

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,880
automated in the next 1 to 3 years.

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
Cool. And you're going to show us all

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,920
the tools you use, some of the

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,920
workflows, maybe even some prompts. Um

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,439
you're you're not going to hold back on

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,400
sauce, are you? No, no, no. I've got

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,360
I've got so much sauce for anybody who

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,600
will listen. Okay, cool. All right,

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,880
let's let's see what you got. Okay, so

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,759
this is my voice AI, which I have dubbed

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,720
lovingly lowballer 9000. Um, he's I His

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,200
name is Alex. I I like to give my AI's

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,960
names because it helps me remember like

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,479
who they are in my head. And he his job

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,960
is basically to do one thing. He is

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,759
looking for a Rolex Daytona and he knows

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,600
that he's talking to luxury watch

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,000
dealers. He needs to do a few things. Um

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,759
he has to gather some like critical

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,479
details which are like hey what uh you

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,840
know what's the condition of the watch

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,560
in? Um do you have all of the original

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,640
documentation and the packaging for the

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
watch? These are like kind of important

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,878
details that you need to have when

50
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,400
negotiating a watch because they can

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,360
like dramatically impact uh the quoted

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,480
cost of the watch.

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,879
Now, to be spec like to be precise,

54
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,360
we're not really calling like Rolex the

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,319
the like factory dealer. We're calling

56
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,640
uh secondhand dealers. So, when I say

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
luxury dealers, I don't mean like Rolex

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,080
official USA in like Rodeo Drive. I mean

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,000
like the the guy who buys the secondhand

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,720
Rolexes in like some spot out in Miami

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,879
or something like these are the people

62
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,599
that I'm targeting and this is the the

63
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,200
platform that I'm using to do all of

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,080
this. This is Vappy u I think literally

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,959
Vappy just amounts to voice API and it's

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,440
basically a very flexible way to build

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,400
voice agents. You can they don't lock

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,720
you into anything proprietary. It's

69
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,480
simply just bring your prompt, pick your

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,720
providers for your different services,

71
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,760
and then literally hit go and run it.

72
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,480
And for the prompt, is this something

73
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
that you wrote yourself or is this

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
something that you prompted like a chat

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,360
GBT to be like, hey, this is what I'm

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,800
trying to do. Like, how do I structure

77
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
this? Um the prompt is something that I

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,159
wrote myself but

79
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,239
also so like okay Vappy has some

80
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
documentation which may have ch may have

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,040
changed by now which is like here are

82
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,760
some general best practices for building

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,959
a prompt but I think like this is a

84
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,440
tricky question because a lot of what my

85
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,120
prompt is doing is reacting to sort of

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
my tests that I conduct. So like my

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,599
general process has been let's watch

88
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,879
people lowball like watch sellers IRL.

89
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,480
So there's a couple content creators who

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,879
I like who do this and then I just try

91
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,360
to like put those um simulate those

92
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,879
conversations with VBY with Alex and

93
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,560
then what'll happen is like Alex will

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,879
respond in a way that I don't like. For

95
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,680
example, like a lot of the times when we

96
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,440
would start the call uh start the

97
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,839
conversation, Alex would just ram every

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
single question I had like down my

99
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,320
throat within the first term. And so I

100
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
was like, uh, this is like, you know, so

101
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,080
uh not engaging. It's so obviously AI,

102
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
like I need to make sure it doesn't do

103
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,320
that. So a lot of what I would do would

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,479
be, okay, where in my prompt can I tell

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,120
it to just, you know, say one thing at a

106
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
time? And I think there's probably

107
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
something in here. Yeah. Like keep

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
concise, keep responses concise. One to

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
two sentences max. So it would just like

110
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,400
if you think about it, it's like if

111
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,199
you're on a boat and your boat has like

112
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,720
a bunch of holes and you're slowly

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,360
sinking. All I'm doing is like going in

114
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
and patching the holes as I'm finding

115
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
it. That was sort of my approach with

116
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,600
the prompt, but it's it's a mix of both

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
to answer your question. Cool. I mean,

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
it also makes sense that you're keeping

119
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,400
the sentences super short and clear

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
because you don't want you don't want

121
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,160
Vappy to mess up. Yeah. Yeah. That's

122
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,639
that's a big deal. Also, also in terms

123
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,080
of uh while we're talking about sauce, I

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,039
don't know where it is in my in here,

125
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,280
but just something general that I

126
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,720
learned is that most conversations

127
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,600
happen at like a sixth grade English

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,840
level. Um, I think this is just true

129
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,120
across I don't know every single

130
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,199
interaction you can possibly or most

131
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,400
human interactions over a phone. So, I

132
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,520
remember when I changed the prompt to

133
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
say like only use like sixth grade

134
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
English, I got way longer call

135
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
durations. I don't have like super

136
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,039
precise metrics, but I remember I

137
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,479
remember talking to it and being like,

138
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,440
"Oh, this sounds so much more human."

139
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,400
And from a model perspective, I see you

140
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,840
have Gemini 20 Flash. Like how how

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,000
should people think about which model

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,720
they should use? Um the model is is

143
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,039
really dependent. So I feel like a lot

144
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,639
of what we a lot of the model game now

145
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,440
is very like flavor of the month. Um in

146
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,199
my video I actually ended up using

147
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,520
DeepSeek before Deepseek had its whole

148
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,720
big hype cycle. Um which was good and

149
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,039
bad. I saved money for the calls that I

150
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,840
w was able to place, but because we went

151
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,919
through that whole hype cycle, my bot

152
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,319
just crashed. It just wasn't making any

153
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,680
calls or like people would call in and

154
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
uh they would say things to my bot and

155
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
then my bot would just not respond. Hey,

156
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm calling about a watch. Do you have a

157
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
second? Yeah.

158
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,199
Yes.

159
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,960
Hello. Hello.

160
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,319
Are you calling Roman Jewelers? How may

161
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,560
I help you out?

162
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,120
Jules in time. This is speaking.

163
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,400
Hello, Jules and Kim.

164
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,639
Hello. Yes. How can I help you?

165
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,240
Prestige Times Stall speaking. Can I

166
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,520
help you?

167
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,960
Hello. Good afternoon, Becker time. This

168
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
is Alex speaking. How can we help you

169
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,520
today?

170
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,199
Quick break in the pod to tell you a

171
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,840
little bit about Startup Empire. So,

172
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,440
Startup Empire is my private membership

173
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,880
where it's a bunch of people like me,

174
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,520
like you who want to build out their

175
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,080
startup ideas. Now, they're looking for

176
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,919
content to help accelerate that. They're

177
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,840
looking for potential co-founders.

178
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,039
They're looking for uh tutorials from

179
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,360
people like me to come in and tell them,

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,039
"How do you do email marketing? How do

181
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,560
you build an audience? How do you go

182
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,319
viral on Twitter?" All these different

183
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,720
things. That's exactly what Startup

184
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,919
Empire is. And it's for people who want

185
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
to start a startup but are looking for

186
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,160
ideas or it's for people who have a

187
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,240
startup but just they're not seeing the

188
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,120
traction uh that they need. So you can

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,160
check out the link to

190
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,840
startupmpire.co in the description and

191
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
that was because uh DeepS API was just

192
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,440
so slammed. It just literally did not

193
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
respond to my request. So pick one

194
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,440
that's available. And what does

195
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,759
temperature mean? I see it says one,

196
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,479
temperature one. Yeah. So temperature is

197
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,400
like how creative do you want his

198
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,039
responses to be? So like if you want a

199
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,520
borderline deterministic system, like a

200
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,200
system that you can sort of uh predict

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,279
really easily, you would put the

202
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,519
temperature closer to zero. Okay. Um,

203
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,200
but then what ends up happening is like

204
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,679
if someone asks a question that isn't

205
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,000
like very common, it won't know how to

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
respond and it'll just pick like a

207
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,080
response that isn't appropriate at all.

208
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
Okay. And so this is the system prompt.

209
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,920
This is where you, you know, configure

210
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,680
which model you use. Um, where do you

211
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,000
pick which voice you use? Because I know

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
you use like some

213
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,160
sopranos. Soprano's voice. Mhm. Mhm. So,

214
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,800
right here under voice, you have the

215
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,240
voice configuration and uh I think in

216
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
this scenario I'm using Cartisia,

217
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,399
although you have, you know, all of the

218
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,279
super popular ones here, but Cartisia

219
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,200
and New York man is what they're calling

220
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
him.

221
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,360
Shots. Definitely. Yeah, definitely not

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
a reference to any sort of fictional

223
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,320
character that's very popular on a very

224
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,440
specific TV show. But are you the seller

225
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,839
with the Rolex Daytona? Responding.

226
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,800
Which Rolex Daytona? Which Rolex Daytona

227
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,279
do you have for sale? Brand new box and

228
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,440
papers. Got it. I love the Italian,

229
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,120
right? It should be New Jersey, man,

230
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,800
because I think the Sopranos were in New

231
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Jersey. Perhaps. Perhaps. These are all

232
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,519
alleged allegations.

233
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,640
Um, so what else do people need to know

234
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,160
about Vappy in terms of like setting it

235
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,959
up and yeah, what else is there to know?

236
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,600
Okay, I I would say probably the most

237
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,240
powerful part of Vappy uh exists in the

238
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,279
tool calls. So tool calling, I don't

239
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,720
know if how many of your audience is

240
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
like familiar, but basically like a

241
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,440
voice AI becomes really powerful when it

242
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
can interact with your existing tools.

243
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,519
So, like for example, I need a way to

244
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,680
record all of the calls. So, I'm going

245
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,320
to share a different tab with you

246
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,880
instead. So, this is my watch list.

247
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,200
Essentially, it's a database that has

248
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,160
every single call my AI has placed. Um,

249
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
the reason for this is because I don't

250
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
want to have to sift through over 800

251
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,399
calls and figure out which calls like

252
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,800
actually resulted in something

253
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,000
actionable. I want my system to tell me

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,399
like here are the calls that we actually

255
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,399
like got an offer on. So I uh what I did

256
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
was I created a tool call that basically

257
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,160
says hey once a conversation is done

258
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
take the entire transcript and tell me

259
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,200
whether or not we actually got an offer

260
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,519
from them. So did they even engage with

261
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,160
our bot and did we lowball them? And if

262
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
we did how much did we lowball them for?

263
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
and did they accept our low ball? And if

264
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,440
they didn't accept our low ball, did

265
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,760
they at least give us another price? And

266
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,640
was that price the final price? So, as

267
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
you can see here in this spreadsheet

268
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,040
that I have, these are all of the calls

269
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,160
that resulted in an offer that they gave

270
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,959
us uh and then whether or not they

271
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,640
accepted or whether or not we got them

272
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,079
down to their absolute lowest price. So,

273
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,839
this made it super easy to sift through

274
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,640
my 800 calls and find the calls that

275
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,320
actually resulted in something that I

276
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
could use in my content.

277
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,320
Cool.

278
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,640
And to tie a knot in that, the way I was

279
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,560
able to do this is right here in the

280
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,240
tool section, you basically create a

281
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,240
tool. I think what I used was get best

282
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,519
offer, which was talk to my Air Table

283
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,720
spreadsheet, get the best offer we have,

284
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,959
and then use it in the negotiation. Mhm.

285
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,160
And I see send to Lindy over there.

286
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
Where where do you see that? Tools under

287
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
tools.

288
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,399
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What were you

289
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
doing there?

290
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,399
I think this is a different I think this

291
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,399
is for a different automation, but I I

292
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,880
definitely um Yeah, I definitely have

293
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,600
this linked in with Lindy in some other

294
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
in some other voice AI. Yeah. I'm just

295
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,200
wondering, I'm trying to give people a

296
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,519
sense of like, okay, how could you kind

297
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,160
of marry like a a a Vappy plus a Lindy?

298
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,160
H Okay. I think what Lindy is really

299
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,120
good at is flexibly taking big amounts

300
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,040
of text and putting it into a

301
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,200
spreadsheet. I think what like Lindy

302
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,040
does really well, let me just like

303
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,320
navigate to Lindy and try to give as

304
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,279
concise of a demonstration as I can. But

305
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,120
like you know when you have like a

306
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,279
spreadsheet and you have like let's say

307
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,360
five columns and let's say you're just

308
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,839
like trying to do your homework on like

309
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,360
restaurants in a new city you're going

310
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,040
to um and then like halfway through your

311
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,360
research you're like oh my god I totally

312
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
forgot my like wife is vegan so I have

313
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,440
to like specify uh which of the

314
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,000
restaurants are vegan friendly. So

315
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
rather so if you have a Lindy that does

316
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,440
this rather or let's say it's a make

317
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,519
automation or some classical non-Lindy

318
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,720
automation you got to go you got to log

319
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
back in you got to add that column to

320
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
your automation and then you have to

321
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,560
write new rules so it's like okay if

322
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,639
there's vegan options on the menu make

323
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,959
sure this is checked Lindy does that for

324
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
you automatically Lindy will read the

325
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,839
name of your column like vegan friendly

326
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,440
and then it'll take the contents of

327
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,639
everything that you're giving it. Maybe

328
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,720
it's like a website scrape or like a

329
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040
menu and then it'll be like, "Oh yeah,

330
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
the salad, the the the non Caesar salad,

331
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,880
the Mediterranean salad, sans feta,

332
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,480
that's vegan friendly." And it'll

333
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
automatically check that for you. You

334
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
don't have to do anything. You don't

335
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,959
have to log back in. You just add that

336
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,399
column into your spreadsheet. You're

337
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,399
done. Um, so I I think I rambled there,

338
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,920
but that's that's what is possible with

339
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
the Lindy and Vappy. Cool. situation.

340
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,680
Yeah, that makes sense. That makes a lot

341
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
of sense. What else do people need to

342
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,279
know if they want to bug a bunch of

343
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,839
secondhand used watch dealers? Or is

344
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,480
this it? What else do they have to know?

345
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,040
Oh man, these guys are not always the

346
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,600
most friendly dudes. Um, no. I mean,

347
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
from like a tool perspective. From a

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,600
tools perspective. Oh man. Oh. Um, yes.

349
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,199
Twilio. So, I think probably the biggest

350
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,920
bottleneck I had, the biggest like

351
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,120
hurdle that I had to clear was getting

352
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
my calls to actually ring the phones. So

353
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,680
there is something called shake and stir

354
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,279
which is like um I think it's an

355
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:18,240
FCC mechanism um enforcement a rule that

356
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,480
they have that basically says hey if you

357
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,800
don't register your phone in our

358
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,399
database so that we can do like

359
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,199
essentially KYC we're just like any

360
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,800
calls you make out of this number we're

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
just not going to honor they're going to

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
go straight to voicemail. Um, so make

363
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
sure that you bring your own number.

364
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,000
Make sure that you've done your KYC and

365
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,839
then start placing calls because I think

366
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,720
I had at least 300 calls go out that

367
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
just straight up went to voicemail. And

368
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,079
could you end like this was a really

369
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,079
cool like this this actually was an aha

370
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,839
moment for me around like what's

371
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,720
possible with voice AI like right now.

372
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,120
Can you end I'd love to just end on this

373
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,639
idea around like okay like cute cute

374
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,560
cute demo but like what else could you

375
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,440
know the average startup founder or

376
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,800
person who wants to like build a

377
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,880
business make money online like what's

378
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,320
what are some interesting things that

379
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,040
they can do besides this off the top of

380
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,959
your head just use cases rattle off some

381
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,560
use cases okay most obvious one sales

382
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,399
let's say you work in real estate and

383
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,040
you have to call people on a prospect

384
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,519
list to like see uh whether or not I

385
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,120
don't know like someone in their family

386
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
has like recently passed or if their

387
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,360
house is like going on the market soon.

388
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,600
So easy. Just say like just make a

389
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,440
prompt that's like hey ask these three

390
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,759
questions that we know uh the answers

391
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,240
to. I mean not for the prospect but if

392
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,920
they answer this way we know that the

393
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,440
house has a this percent chance more

394
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,279
likely possibility to appear on the

395
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,040
market in the next six months. I'm sure

396
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,040
someone has that uh criteria and that

397
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,880
data to make that insight. And then you

398
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,199
just take that, turn it into a prompt,

399
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,680
call like 30,000 numbers, and you will

400
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,480
have people on that list who meet your

401
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,520
criteria who you can then

402
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:12,160
pursue. Um that okay, that's one uh

403
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,079
here here's here's a framework for

404
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,520
thinking about how I would I would use

405
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,720
something like this.

406
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,520
So I think that

407
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,000
um building vapy AI voice agents is

408
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,559
great to get

409
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,799
uh data where it's basically just a

410
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,480
great way to get data. It's a really

411
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,160
great way to get data to give you an

412
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,080
unfair advantage. So what you did with

413
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,760
um the secondhand watches was like you

414
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
can create an arbitrage business around

415
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
that, right? like if you're like there's

416
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,200
literally thousands of dollars of of

417
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,120
of arbitrage that you can be doing. So

418
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,640
the question is what are other

419
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
businesses and this is something that

420
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,080
you can literally prompt like a chat GBT

421
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,200
but like what are other businesses where

422
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
getting data allows you to do some

423
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
arbitrage and I just think you can

424
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,919
literally go one by one and if people

425
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,840
are interested maybe I can do a another

426
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,440
tutorial on on like what voice AI agents

427
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,640
business ideas are but like ones that

428
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,640
require like if data is an unfair

429
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,280
advantage. If if knowledge is an unfair

430
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,400
advantage and knowing something more

431
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
than your competitor,

432
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,280
then chances are that there's a voice AI

433
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,320
opportunity there. Yeah, I that's a good

434
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,760
way to look at No, I don't think you're

435
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,880
wrong in that because I think when you

436
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,480
asked me the first time like what what

437
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,160
would you teach people if you had the

438
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,919
opportunity? That's kind of what I was

439
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,440
trying to tell you. I was like I think

440
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,919
this voice AI like can create a more

441
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,240
transparent second market, secondary

442
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,600
market. um whether like what sort of

443
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,360
businesses you can make off of that I

444
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
think are really up to people who are

445
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,000
deeply entrenched in those businesses.

446
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,919
Uh it's like I'm blanking because I'm

447
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,400
being put on the spot, but like you're

448
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,080
right. Anything that's arbitrage I mean

449
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,039
that's essentially what I'm

450
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,880
demonstrating here, right? Is like go

451
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,760
buy this watch for $19,000 from this one

452
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,679
person that you heard me talk to and

453
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,440
then go on the secondary market and sell

454
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,760
it for like 22 and make like three grand

455
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,679
or Yeah. Three grand and then do that at

456
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,120
scale. Yeah. Yeah. And then do that at

457
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,200
scale. And then like, you know, just you

458
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
can automate this even further. Like

459
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,799
every time someone gives you that offer,

460
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,039
just like dispatch a team to go pick it

461
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,720
up. Yeah. What are you What are you

462
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,280
people doing listening to us? Just go do

463
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,039
it. Just go. Um Tony, uh thank you for

464
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,360
coming on. I appreciate you. Of course.

465
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,240
Um for people who don't know Tony, uh

466
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,080
I've included his social. his socials,

467
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,919
where to find him, follow his journey,

468
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,160
his YouTube is awesome. That's in the

469
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
show notes. He also does, you know,

470
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,559
thankfully he comes and he does um you

471
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,240
do demos within Startup Empire, don't

472
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,200
you? Yeah. Uh very active on Startup

473
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,600
Empire. I am on the core team as you

474
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,000
know. I was, you know, built a lot of

475
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,919
the automations that make it possible.

476
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
Uh do a lot of content in there whenever

477
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,160
I can. What do you what are some things

478
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,000
that you've you've taught in Startup

479
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,240
Empire? Um, I did a I did a breakdown of

480
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,280
how I built our feedback bot. So, we

481
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
have another voice AI that basically

482
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,159
collects feedback from people who are in

483
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,640
Start of Empire. So, like my big insight

484
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,559
was like I hate having to fill out a

485
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,080
feedback form every time I'm like

486
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,320
leaving a community. It's just like too

487
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,400
much work and I have too much to say,

488
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,880
but like it's fine if I want to just

489
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,559
brain dump, but like no one will listen

490
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,480
to me brain dump. So wait, why don't I

491
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,159
just make a voice AI to like listen to

492
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,799
someone brain dump or listen to people

493
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,640
who are leaving Startup Empire brain

494
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,760
dump or people who are happy with

495
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
Startup Empire brain dump and then we

496
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
can take that information and categorize

497
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,080
it and classify it and use it to like

498
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
improve the service which is crazy. So

499
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,440
there's a Slack. So for people who don't

500
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,039
know, Startup Empire is our private

501
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,960
membership uh for people who want to

502
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,120
build cash flowing internet businesses.

503
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,520
There's we have a Slack

504
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,799
uh channel where uh it I don't know how

505
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,400
it does it. I'm curious, Tony. Actually,

506
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,760
we've never spoken about this, but

507
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,039
basically it posts the feedback that

508
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,039
people are they're calling this like

509
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,520
call it a 1-800 number. It's not a 1800

510
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,480
number, but this number. They're calling

511
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,679
this number and they're like, I love

512
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,360
Startup Empire. I learned these two

513
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
three two three things two or three

514
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
things I really liked or I hate Startup

515
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,559
Empire and I wish you would do this

516
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,600
better. and it posts to our Slack and it

517
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,679
summarizes it. It's insane. So then as

518
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,440
like me, as someone who wants to make to

519
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,480
add value to this product, um it's so

520
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,600
amazing, right? Yeah. We get we get our

521
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
feed we don't have to go anywhere to get

522
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,520
our feedback. It comes to us. We get to

523
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
see it. It's it's in the same channel as

524
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
like our subscription notifications.

525
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,039
It's Yeah, it's nice. I think that's

526
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,360
actually a Lindy. It's Lindy, right?

527
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,280
Yeah, I think that's Lindy. And by the

528
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,679
way, like someone here's a free business

529
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,400
idea. Go do that for other companies.

530
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,760
Every company would pay for that. We

531
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
should do that, dude. We should do that.

532
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,159
Sure. Actually, you know what? Think

533
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,840
about it. Like for three $300 a month,

534
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,120
they'll come in. We'll come and we'll
