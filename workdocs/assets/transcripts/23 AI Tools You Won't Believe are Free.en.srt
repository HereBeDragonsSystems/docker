1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,680
For the last eight months I've been experimenting 
with as many AI tools as possible, every day. 

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,000
It's for this channel but you 
could also call it an obsession. 

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,760
I've taken my whole list of tools and narrowed it  

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,040
down to the best free option for every 
use case, and I mean actually free.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,800
Let's start with a couple 
that are just really fun,  

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,960
then we'll get into the more practical.
With Luma Labs you're able to take a video  

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,520
on your phone and turn it into a fully 
interactive highly detailed 3D scene

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,960
like this

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,680
That uses Neural Radiance Fields or NeRFs 
they also released a new feature called  

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,720
Interactive Scenes that uses gaussian splatting.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,680
And you don't have to know either of those terms.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,880
The interactive scenes have a small file size so  

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,680
you can embed them anywhere or send 
it to a friend for them to explore.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,680
There's endless uses for this in retail, real 
estate, travel, we'll start seeing these across  

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,160
tons of Industries but also for creative uses 
as well as my favorite reliving old memories.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
Just download the free app on your phone,  

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,120
there's uploads from other users 
you can check out for inspiration.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,200
I love the way these look when they load.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,320
Then you just move your finger 
around on the screen to navigate.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,440
To create your own either start a 
new capture and follow the steps  

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,160
on the screen or you can take 
a normal video outside the app. 

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,600
Just walk around a scene or if you're 
doing an object you'll get the best  

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,520
results if you do multiple circles 
around it each from different heights.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,920
Just upload and let it render. Once 
it's finished you can navigate around  

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,240
the scene right on your phone or you can 
go to the web version on your computer.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,520
You can create custom videos using key frames,  

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,880
you can guide the camera movement throughout 
the scene in any direction at any angle.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,560
Here's a really cool one I saw on 
Twitter from Ruben Fro using Unity,  

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,520
so you can import these into game engines if you 
want there's a lot of different export formats.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,440
One of the ideas I'm working on 
is using Google Earth Studio.

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,640
It's another free tool, you can pick anywhere 
on Earth and it will zoom in or zoom between  

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,280
locations. They have presets to do it really 
quickly or an area where you can fine-tune  

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,920
exactly how fast it moves and the angles it takes. 
It's really fun to play around with and easy to  

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,160
jump in and use. There's a lot of tutorials on 
YouTube if you want more complex camera movements.

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:11,120
This seems like a good spot to test out a NeRF

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,320
That was my first test combining those 
tools I don't have the process dialed  

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,720
in yet but I think it has some 
potential. Either way these are  

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,240
both really fun tools to mess 
around with each on their own.

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,560
Luma Labs has one more recent release 
called Genie. It's a text-to-3D model  

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,640
that's free right now during the research phase.

41
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,000
It's operated in the Luma Discord server in any 
of these Genie channels using the Genie command.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,800
Just add your prompt and it generates 
incredibly fast and is by far the  

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,000
best version of text-to-3D I've come 
across in terms of quality and time.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,280
There's people rigging entire scenes 
with this that look amazing. I don't  

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:59,760
know how long this will be free 
but here's a few more examples.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,600
I'll go into a lot more creative 
stuff for music, images, video,  

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,280
and 3D but I'm also very into productivity and 
learning tools so let's switch to that for a few.

48
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,040
One of my favorites that I use all the 
time is Perplexity. It's a fine-tuned  

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,540
ChatGPT. Basically an interactive Search 
Assistant that you can ask anything.

50
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,959
It uses up-to-date information and browses 
the web across multiple sources and comes  

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,840
back with concise answers almost instantly. 
It shows you what sources it used and you  

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,920
can click through to the article for 
further reading. It starts responding  

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,959
immediately and sometimes will cite like 
10 sources all in one response if needed.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,600
And if you're using the desktop 
version it can pull up images  

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,760
too. You can also upload PDFs 
and ask questions about them.

56
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,000
I use the mobile app most and find myself using it  

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,080
over Google most of the time 
for question based searches.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,840
There is a pro version but 
the free version is huge,  

59
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,400
I've never felt any need to 
upgrade from the free plan.

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,640
And I'm only talking about tools that 
have really robust free plans like this.  

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,559
I want to mention when they have paid upgrades 
available mainly to give you the full picture  

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
of how much comes in the free plan, that 
way you won't waste your time experimenting  

63
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,640
with something only to find out you have to 
pay to do what you actually wanted it for.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,200
SciSpace is the easiest way to find, learn, 
and understand any research paper, so,  

65
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,560
similar to Perplexity but this only cites research 
papers, not websites or the overall internet.

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,680
So it's geared towards people that are 
students or researchers, but it's great  

67
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,600
for anyone that has questions in the realm of 
science that wants research-backed answers.

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,720
Ask any question and it will give you 
insight from the top five papers up  

69
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,200
at the top with citations you can click 
through to read the paper and then more  

70
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,920
relevant papers below. You can also chat with 
the copilot about the answers you received.

71
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,400
Another cool feature is you can 
upload a PDF of any paper and get  

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,560
a summary and ask questions related 
to the paper. You could also add the  

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,160
Chrome extension to use all those 
features while you're browsing.

74
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,920
If you're reading a paper online you 
can ask it to simplify complex language,  

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,440
ask clarifying questions, clip math equations 
or tables to find out what they mean,  

76
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,320
it's a really powerful research 
tool to get answers in real time.

77
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,880
All of that is completely free they do have some 
additional features for writing that are paid.

78
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,440
Here's one more in this realm similar to 
perplexity but built right into Google,  

79
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,719
it's their new Search Generative Experience, 
which also just got the ability for text-to-image

80
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,320
This is an experimental feature you 
can turn on to use AI in search. It  

81
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,520
pops up on the top of your search and 
gives a concise summary of some answers  

82
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,760
with sources on the side. You can expand it 
to read more and ask follow-up questions.

83
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,440
It can be really helpful in a lot of 
situations so I have it turned on all the time.

84
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,000
To set it up go to labs.google.com

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,240
Click get started then switch it on. 
There's some additional options here  

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,080
for coding and adding AI to sheets. 
And you can get back to turn the AI  

87
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,840
on and off at any time with 
the beaker in the top right.

88
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,919
They also very recently added in 
the ability to generate images.  

89
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,440
You just type in the search bar 
what you want it to generate.

90
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,600
From there you can click ask a followup and 
then you'll have a nice space to generate  

91
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,440
in. You can add follow-up prompts to change 
things until you have something you like.

92
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,040
I actually liked this one with 
the guitar. Click export and  

93
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,920
download or hit edit to go into a new workspace

94
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,480
There's a button to have it help you write 
a better prompt, let's give that a try.

95
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,680
Sometimes it ends up not generating all the images  

96
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,240
I think it's just censoring 
itself, but this one is solid.

97
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,480
There's more text to image generators 
that do a better job at various things,  

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,120
I will be covering those a bit later.

99
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,280
Now I wanted to pack this video with 
as much information as possible,  

100
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,159
and that is made possible by 
today's sponsor, Skillshare.

101
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
Before I started this channel I wanted 
to get better at video editing, I knew  

102
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,440
the basics but I wanted to really 
improve so I went to Skillshare.

103
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,719
This is the course I watched 
by Phil Ebiner, it was great.

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
I used what I learned in that course to 
make my first few videos on this channel.

105
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,640
I've of course learned more since then 
and am always trying to get better,  

106
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,479
but that course was extremely helpful.

107
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,600
And this channel did grow from 0 to over 
100,000 subscribers in 8 months so, not bad.

108
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,920
And I've used Skillshare over the years for 
all sorts of stuff: photography, Photoshop,  

109
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,360
illustration, a lot of creative courses, 
I also took some for coding a while back.

110
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,600
And they have a wide range of other 
courses on like entrepreneurship,  

111
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,680
social media, marketing, productivity 
and a ton of other niche topics as well.

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,000
Honestly, I take a lot of courses. I have time 
carved out every week that I dedicate to learning  

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,240
new skills. That involves multiple sources, of 
course, but one of the main ones is Skillshare.

114
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,480
I love the learn by doing approach 
they take. Each course has something  

115
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,440
actionable with a project you 
can share and get feedback on.

116
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,760
I've gotten a lot from Skillshare so it was an  

117
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,200
easy choice when they reached 
out about sponsoring a video.

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,960
And the first 500 people to use my link will get 
their first month of Skillshare membership free.

119
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,239
You can watch multiple entire courses in that  

120
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,840
first month to make sure you like the 
platform then continue on if you do.

121
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,400
So thank you to Skillshare for sponsoring this 
video and for helping me create this channel.

122
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,320
Now let's move on to some music tools.

123
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,120
This next one is really fun 
and can get kind of ridiculous.

124
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,280
It's called Suno and it can generate you a song  

125
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,080
with instruments and vocals 
just from writing a topic.

126
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,479
It's operated within Discord 
so I'll have the link to the  

127
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,920
Discord server below with all the other links.

128
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,520
Go to one of the chirp beta 
channels, use the chirp command,  

129
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,760
and either submit your own lyrics or write a 
topic and have ChatGPT write the lyrics for you.

130
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,080
Let's do the greatest movie of all time.

131
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,760
The Big Lebowski

132
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Then you can type a genre. If you leave it as 
random it will choose based off the lyrics.

133
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,240
Bluegrass seems like a good fit.

134
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,760
And that's all there is to it. The verse 
and chorus will come back right away. 

135
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,360
Nailed it.

136
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,160
Then usually just another minute or 
so and it will come back with two  

137
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,490
different options up to 40 seconds 
long each let's give it a listen

138
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,400
[Music] In a world of bowling balls and weed,
there's a man they called The Dude indeed

139
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:29,239
[Music] his robe and is White Russian in hand,
living life in his own laid-back land

140
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,400
[Music] He's The Big Lebowski, that's his name

141
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,319
That's pretty solid, especially considering all I  

142
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
entered was a few words. And there is 
an option to continue it if you want.

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,919
Another fun one is to use 
lyrics from a popular song  

144
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:53,333
and see how it interprets it. I'll 
try Purple Haze with a random genre.

145
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,040
[Music] Purple haze all in my brain,
Lately things just don't seem the same

146
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,860
[Music] acting funny but I don't know why,
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

147
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,640
[Music] Purple haze all around,
don't know if I'm coming up or down

148
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,840
[Music] Am I happy or in misery whatever it is,
That girl put a spell on me

149
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,640
That's actually insane how good that is. I'm 
going to continue that for a future project.

150
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,000
I originally scripted this section 
when it was 100% free and unlimited,  

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,320
but they have changed that now you get 
five chirps per day under the free plan.

152
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,760
They do have a paid option if you want,  

153
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,960
but this is mostly just a quick tool I use 
for fun so the free plan has been plenty.

154
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,560
The next one is in the same 
realm but completely free and  

155
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,479
open source. It was released 
by Meta it's called MusicGen.

156
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,360
It generates music under tons of different 
genres really well, but this time no vocals.

157
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,720
There's a couple ways to use 
it I'll show the easiest one  

158
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,240
first someone built a better 
interface called Waveformer.

159
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,840
You just enter a prompt with whatever 
you want your music to sound like:  

160
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,280
genre, instruments, tempo, feel.

161
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,040
Click submit and let it generate. It takes a  

162
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:28,160
minute or two then usually comes 
back with a great sounding song.

163
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,200
There is another feature where you can give it an 
input Melody to follow but they didn't add that  

164
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,200
into Waveformer, so if you want to use that, 
you need to go to the space on Hugging Face.

165
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:50,840
Upload a file that has a melody in it, I'll 
use the outdated reference of the X Files theme

166
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,600
So you describe the music 
you want then it will use  

167
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,760
the description and the melody to create a song.

168
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,040
Let's see what we got.

169
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,200
When I think of the implications of 
that combined with Suno and some of  

170
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,760
the other technologies that are coming 
out and advancing rapidly, I won't be  

171
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,400
surprised at all if people start listening 
to music that's fully generated by AI soon.

172
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,240
This last music one is a really cool suite  

173
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,800
of tools developed by Google in 
collaboration with Lupe Fiasco.

174
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,199
They help with lyric writing but 
in a collaborative way where the  

175
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,160
artist is really involved in the process.

176
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,680
They're all free and really easy to jump 
in and mess around with. I like this a lot.

177
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Here's a clip from their promo video

178
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,479
This bite-sized AI tool that 
can take in any word as input,  

179
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,560
explode it into all these different 
possibilities in the same way that Lupe does

180
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,479
and that's just one tool we 
built nine others as well

181
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,520
It's called textfx.

182
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,560
These tools, they generate similes, 
they create acronyms, they parse words,  

183
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,239
it's a entire suite of different kinds of 
possibilities dealing with text and language

184
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
Now onto the more visual side.

185
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,560
Probably the easiest way to 
animate an image is with LeiaPix

186
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,719
Go to convert.leiapix.com

187
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,120
click upload and easy as that, you 
have an immersive depth animation.

188
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,280
There's sliders to change how long the 
animation cycle is and the way it animates,  

189
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,439
also an advanced editor where 
you can get more customizable.

190
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,880
Then just select your export format. It's 
super easy but I love the way these look

191
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:38,040
[Music]

192
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,640
You get 60 credits when you join,  

193
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,360
but to export in full resolution costs 20 
credits so it's really only three uses.

194
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,160
I have no idea why they call that 60 
credits but I included it because you  

195
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,719
get unlimited free exports in 720p which 
is still pretty high quality. Also you  

196
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,320
can export unlimited depth maps for free 
which we will use in our next tool, Insta3D

197
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,719
This is by Ilumine AI

198
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,520
it's kind of like LeiaPix but 
makes it even more immersive

199
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,079
This is the home screen, there's some 
samples you can test out at the bottom.  

200
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,880
A bunch of these look really cool and 
gives you a good idea of what works  

201
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,640
well in here. Then right here 
you can upload your own image.

202
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,880
Once you've done that you 
need to upload a depth map,  

203
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,640
so back to LeiaPix, upload your 
photo, then export depth map.

204
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,920
Now upload that in Insta3D and it's good to go.

205
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,439
You can move all around the scene.

206
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,000
They have some different effects down at the 
bottom to mess around with. Some types of images  

207
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,600
work really well for this and any of them start 
to get a little wonky when you go far into them,  

208
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:40,140
but it is really amazing that you can 
generate this so easily from a 2D image.

209
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,840
[Music]

210
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,160
This one is research from Meta, it's fun 
and really easy to use. It's designed to  

211
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
animate children's drawings but you can 
upload any character you want. It just  

212
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,360
needs to be on a white background 
with each limb separate and visible

213
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,760
Click upload photo, agree, then adjust the frame 
here if it doesn't capture the full character.

214
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,720
On the next page you can fix 
the mask if there's any issues

215
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,640
then find each of the joints

216
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,000
then let it do its thing

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,480
and there it is we have a bunch of 
different animations to choose from. Again,  

218
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,120
it's made to animate children's drawings so 
a lot of the animations are pretty silly,  

219
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,800
but it's fun to mess around with.

220
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,079
You could key out the background 
and let it play over another image,

221
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,500
also it looks completely ridiculous 
if you upload a real person

222
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,040
[Music]

223
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,920
On to Pika Labs which is amazing and absolutely 
incredible that it's still 100% free.

224
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,479
I'm sure at some point they're going to move  

225
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,080
to a paid model but it's been free 
for months and still is currently.

226
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,120
It's all within Discord as well. You can 
operate it in their generate channels,  

227
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,280
or to generate in private come up to the Pika bot,  

228
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,640
click this member list button if you don't see 
it, then right-click the bot, and hit message.

229
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,199
Now you'll be able to DM the bot 
anytime you want to generate.

230
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,600
Use the create command, and for 
text-to-video just type your prompt.

231
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,200
There is a parameter for frame rate if you want

232
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,760
-fps and a number between 8 and 24

233
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:06,240
then aspect ratio is -ar

234
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,240
That looks great but I hardly 
ever use text-to-video,  

235
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,360
image-to-video is where it gets really powerful.

236
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,920
I'll use the create command again, then 
type what I want to happen in the image,  

237
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,439
I'll use the capybara playing 
guitar I generated with Google SGE,  

238
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,080
and another parameter is camera 
movement like zoom in, pan, or rotate

239
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,520
it's -camera then I'll try to zoom in

240
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,600
Click the plus one to add 
the image, then hit enter

241
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,480
That looks awesome. So you can dial in 
really solid images first then use Pika  

242
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,200
to animate them and the possibilities are endless

243
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,040
CapCut has a whole suite of AI tools that are 
in beta under the magic tools tab. There's a  

244
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,319
bunch of different tools here, many of 
which can be found on other platforms,  

245
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,040
but the one I want to highlight is this video 
upscaler. You can upscale videos by 2x which is  

246
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,680
perfect for videos from Pika those are at 
720p and this will convert them to 1080p.

247
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,359
I started using this recently and haven't seen 
any mention of a limit to the free uses on this or  

248
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,200
any of the other tools. So currently this is the 
best free video upscaler I've been able to find

249
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,880
Those are some great video tools, but 
a lot of the time you need to start  

250
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,120
with an image. And before we jump into 
the image generators; something that's  

251
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,360
useful for any images you may have, ai or 
otherwise, is upscaling and restoration.

252
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,240
Most of the upscalers I come 
across have limited uses,  

253
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,200
but there's two that are 
completely free and unlimited.

254
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,760
Replicate has a full suite of 
image restoration and upscalers,  

255
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,880
upscaling is under Super Resolution.

256
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,520
You'll find a bunch of models for different 
needs, some can 4x the resolutions, some  

257
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,640
will de-noise and smooth it out, others will add 
some detail. Pick one for your needs and run it.

258
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,400
The other option I use in 
Replicate is image restoration

259
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,360
There's a ton of cool ones in here for touching 
up old photos, colorizing black and white photos,  

260
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,360
night enhancement, or what I find 
the most mind-blowing: de-blurring

261
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,280
[Music]

262
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,560
Replicate is great for quick web-based upscaling 
but if you want something you can run on your own  

263
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,599
computer that has the option to batch upscale, 
Upscayl spelled with a y .org is the way to go.

264
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,679
It's free, open source software you can download.

265
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,920
It has multiple options to choose from 
for different types of upscaling. Most  

266
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,280
of the time I like this real esran 4X 
you can even upscale it to 16x if you  

267
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,599
want. I also like the digital art model 
for some cartoons or vector art styles,  

268
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,079
that smooths it out a bit. If you regularly need 
to upscale images then I highly recommend this,  

269
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,720
and a lot of images that come out of 
these AI art generators do need upscaling.

270
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,640
Now for the cool this name on the list:

271
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,800
Illusion Diffusion

272
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,240
There's a ton of awesome ways to use 
this. It was originally trained to  

273
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,680
make these really cool QR codes you may have seen,  

274
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,960
then Mr Ugleh figured out this workflow 
for these spirals and other illusions.

275
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,920
I love these look, it reminds me of...

276
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,880
these, by Octavio Ocampo

277
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,040
So yeah, I love this style. It's a ton 
of fun and you can do it all for free.

278
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,240
They have some examples to use 
down here. I like the spiral a lot.

279
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,960
Illusion strength is how much the spiral will 
impact the image, between .8 and 1.2 is a good  

280
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,480
starting point. It depends on what you're 
going for and can take some experimenting.

281
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,320
Type in your prompt then click run.

282
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,639
Timeframes will vary based on the time of day,  

283
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,920
it's usually around 30 seconds or less for me 
but it can be much longer during peak hours.

284
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,280
And that looks awesome.

285
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,240
The illusion strength has the 
biggest impact on how this turns out,  

286
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,000
that's the main option I usually 
adjust when I'm fine-tuning these.  

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,840
There are also some advanced options 
you can mess around with to adjust it  

288
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:28,439
further but here's that same prompt run 
but only changing the illusion strength.

289
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,120
Instead of using their images you can upload 
your own and the possibilities are endless.

290
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,719
A couple common ones are text,

291
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,160
other cool patterns,

292
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,920
logos,

293
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,840
and faces

294
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,600
and a lot of these you have 
to shrink down or squint to  

295
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
see the illusion so keep that in 
mind as you're fine-tuning them.

296
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,840
Someone who went all out with 
this is Herolias on Reddit,  

297
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,120
they spent 14 hours doing this for 
every frame of Never Gonna Give You Up.

298
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,159
You pause at any point and it's a normal 
landscape then hit play and get Rick-Rolled

299
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,160
There's so much that can be done, an 
easier one is to create a brand promo  

300
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,520
video using a logo. I'll do the 
YouTube logo. Then add a prompt.

301
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:14,540
That comes back looking great. I did that 
with a bunch of different prompts and boom

303
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,080
Now for the text to image generators.

304
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,240
There's a ton of options out there, 
each have their pros and cons.

305
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,160
The first three are pretty 
straightforward and easy to use,  

306
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,320
the last one is the most versatile with 
the most features so I'll go more in depth.

307
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,560
We'll start with Ideogram.

308
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,040
If I click over onto this top tab you'll start to 
see what it can do well and where it struggles.

309
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,080
It's great with text based designs, logos, and 
illustrations. This isn't going to be as good as  

310
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,280
the others for things like photo realism or 
getting really specific with what you want.

311
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,240
When you type your prompt it will pop 
up with a bunch of different styles,  

312
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,040
you can choose one if you want, or 
just direct it with your prompt. Then  

313
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,040
there's a couple aspect ratios 
to choose from, and generate.

314
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,840
It comes back with four options, if 
there's one you want to work with,  

315
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,040
you can click remix and it will generate 
four more that are similar. You can  

316
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:10,960
do that as many times as you want 
until you have something you like.

Dalle3 was just rolled out to Pro users 
in ChatGPT so you can use it there if you  

319
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,440
have ChatGPT Pro. If not, you can use 
it for free in the Bing Image Creator.

320
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,760
You just type your prompt and hit 
create. It does a good job with text,  

321
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,840
the best part is it's prompt understanding.

322
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,720
You can get really specific with 
what you want and it nails it.

And now that we're in the text to image 
section I'll just revisit Google SGE quickl,  

326
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,080
that's a really good option that is completely  

327
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:58,120
free to generate as much as you 
want here's a few more examples

Stable Diffusion is open 
source, uncensored, and amazing.

330
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,960
If you have a capable computer you can 
install it locally and use it completely free,  

331
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,960
but that involves some technical 
steps and is not beginner friendly.

332
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,280
Other platforms have been 
built on top that utilize  

333
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,480
Stable Diffusion and make it much easier to use.

334
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,000
For most of them the free plans are very limited, 
but there is a platform that's extremely versatile  

335
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,360
with a ton of features, and the free plan gives 
you 500 Generations per day which is huge.

336
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,120
It's called Playground AI.

337
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,479
It's a canvas-based platform where you have a 
full workspace to move around and create in.

338
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,760
It looks intimidating at first, 
but it's really powerful.

339
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,080
These are all just from today under the free plan.

340
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,679
When you're on the canvas you can 
drag the corners here to change  

341
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,520
your size and aspect ratio, under the 
frame is where you can type a prompt:

342
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,480
anthropomorphic frog playing a banjo

343
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,120
on the right are some options you 
can learn and mess around with,  

344
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,760
I'll just use this one for 
four generations at a time.

345
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,320
On the left is where we can choose the style to 
apply to the image, it has a huge impact. This  

346
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,360
whole workspace was basically just me testing out 
the different styles, I'll demo them in a second.

347
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,080
Hit generate and it goes pretty quick.

348
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,919
And every one of these looks amazing

350
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,120
Let's say I like this composition 
but want some variations,  

351
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,800
the image-to-image button will use 
this as a reference image then I can  

352
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,000
adjust the strength over here. You 
could adjust the prompt or style too

353
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,560
Now I've got four more to choose from.

354
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:27,960
That was all with the Haze style here's some 
other of my favorite styles using the same prompt

[Music]

356
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,000
So we've got some cool images but there's a lot 
more we can do. Up here was with the Neon Mecha  

357
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,600
style, these turned out awesome so I made a bunch. 
I also did anthropomorphic frog playing a fiddle.

358
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,520
I didn't really prompt for scenery, 
but these two looked similar and  

359
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,480
I want to merge them. I can move the 
generation box over the gap and generate.

360
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,520
That combined them well but there 
is this weird robot-looking thing  

361
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,960
right here. No worries, I'll just use the eraser.

362
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,880
That doesn't look perfect, but I'm going 
to be bringing in a singer anyways.

363
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,480
This should look good, but I need to remove 
the background so hit remove background.  

364
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,040
Then I'll drag it on here and make it look 
nice, crop off the bottom, and there it is.

365
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,800
That's a fast and easy composite shot.

366
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,600
So I'll select the whole thing then copy 
and paste, now it's one image I can export

367
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,280
There are tons and tons of other 
features in here. If you want to learn,  

368
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
a really good resource is their YouTube channel.

369
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,320
Now that I've got this image, let's 
see how it looks animated with Pika.

370
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,760
That's not bad, but I think there's just too 
much going on with it. I had a ton of other  

371
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,720
images so I'm going to animate those 
then I want to add a song from Suno.

372
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll use the chirp command, and these 
frogs have a kind of futuristic style.

373
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,960
They look like a prog rock band to me,  

374
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,040
then they're kind of cyborg-looking 
so frog cyborg for the topic.

375
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,560
And actually, I think I have to do it...

376
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,280
