1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,839
By far the easiest business to start

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,000
right now needs no products, no fancy

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,160
marketing, and no coding skills. It's

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,839
not drop shipping, it's not social media

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,320
marketing, and it's not crypto either.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,320
It's helping normal businesses to

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,599
understand and use AI tools like CHBT.

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,279
And this is exactly why billionaires

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,520
like Kevin Oly and Mark Cuban say that

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,119
it's the first business they would start

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,199
right now if they were starting again

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
from zero. I think everything is looking

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,400
at AI now. I would go to businesses

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
because businesses don't understand AI

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,640
yet. And I know this works because I've

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,239
done it. It was two years ago where I

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,680
was like where many of you are right

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,120
now, no AI experience, no degree, and

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,040
just curious about AI and wanting a

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,879
better life for myself. And since then,

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,160
I've built multiple different AI

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,079
businesses that are on track to generate

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
$10 million in revenue this year. And

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,760
I've created at the same time the

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160
biggest AI YouTube channel and also the

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
biggest AI business community in the

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,480
world with over 160,000 members. And it

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,320
all started by helping regular

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,160
businesses to use simple AI tools like

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
Chat GBT, which is exactly what you're

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,400
about to learn. This complete 6-hour AI

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,720
business masterass gives you my exact

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,240
blueprint. It's the same one that

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,520
thousands of beginners in my community

35
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
have used to build real AI businesses,

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,799
helping local businesses to understand

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,320
and implement AI. So, here's how this

38
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,520
video is going to work. I have put

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,200
together my best YouTube content over

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,880
the past few years in the exact order

41
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
that you'll need in order to start your

42
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,320
own AI business. In chapter one for the

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
newbies, we'll explore the AI business

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,439
landscape. I'm going to be showing you

45
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,759
how big this opportunity really is, the

46
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,200
types of AI businesses that you can

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
start, and I'll help you overcome the

48
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,880
doubts that you're probably having about

49
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,240
whether or not you can actually do this

50
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
and whether you can start an AI

51
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
business. In chapter 2, we're going to

52
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
focus on actually starting your AI

53
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,560
business. The videos in this section are

54
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
going to help you to find where to begin

55
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,400
your journey. How to build AI skills

56
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,720
quickly. How to choose profitable niches

57
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
and pick the best one for you and get

58
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,560
your first client, price your services,

59
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,079
and basically everything you need to get

60
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,680
your business off the ground and go from

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
zero to one. And finally, in chapter 3,

62
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,200
we'll talk about how to scale your AI

63
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
business. And I'll be sharing how I

64
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,399
scaled my AI businesses from 10K per

65
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,479
month all the way to $100,000 per month

66
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,560
and beyond. And most importantly, how to

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
avoid the same mistakes that trip myself

68
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,080
and most others up. So, if you're

69
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
serious about becoming an AI

70
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,959
entrepreneur and building the life of

71
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,640
your dreams, then close out all of your

72
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
tabs right now. Save this video to your

73
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,239
watch later so that you don't forget to

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,000
come back to it. Grab a notebook and a

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,680
pen and your drink of choice. Feel free

76
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
to skip around this video if you already

77
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
have an AI business and you're ready to

78
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
sort of jump ahead. But if you're a

79
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
beginner and just starting off your AI

80
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,680
business journey, then buckle up and get

81
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
ready to discover the amazing future

82
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
that awaits you in this AI business

83
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,239
world. If you want to learn a little bit

84
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,680
more about me and my story, I will link

85
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
my whole my story video in the

86
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,879
description. But without further ado,

87
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,080
I'm so excited for you to start this

88
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,519
journey and I hope to see you in my free

89
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,720
community Q&As's very soon.

90
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,920
If I was 25 years old today in 2024,

91
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
what would I do? What's a good sector to

92
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
get involved in? What business would I

93
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
get involved in? If I was a 16-year-old

94
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
kid and I needed to start a side hustle

95
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,879
to make some money, I think everything

96
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,760
is looking at now in a different way. As

97
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,120
businesses, particularly small to

98
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
mediumsiz businesses, don't understand

99
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
yet. The majority of businesses in

100
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,080
America, for example, are between 5 and

101
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,159
500 employees. So, they're small

102
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,959
businesses. They create 62% of the jobs

103
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,200
they want to use. And I doesn't matter

104
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,519
if I'm 16, I'd be teaching them as well.

105
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
Sound complicated? Yes, it is. But is it

106
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
lucrative? very much. So, it's not about

107
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,080
how hard you row, it's about what bill

108
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
you're at. It's imaginational and

109
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,640
they'll pay you.

110
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
Two years ago, I spotted exactly what

111
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,040
these billionaires are just now telling

112
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
everyone to jump into. And back then,

113
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,959
people thought I was insane. And fast

114
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,480
forward to today, I've built a

115
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
multi-million dollar business with over

116
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,640
40 people based out of our Oakland

117
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,879
office here in New Zealand. All because

118
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,040
I saw this coming before anyone else

119
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
did. In the next 20 minutes, I'm going

120
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,879
to show you why this opportunity is so

121
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,120
glaringly obvious that these billioners

122
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
are literally begging people to start

123
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,519
these kinds of businesses. And more

124
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,560
importantly, I'll be breaking down how

125
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,400
almost anyone can start one of

126
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,840
them. So, what is this no-brainer

127
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
opportunity that Shark Tanks Kevin Olri

128
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
and Mark Cuban both say is the first

129
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
business they would start if they were

130
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,239
starting again as an entrepreneur today?

131
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,920
Let's see if you can figure it out. If I

132
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,120
was 25 years old today in 2024, what

133
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,959
would I do? What's a good sector to get

134
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,320
involved in? What business would I get

135
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
involved in? I think everything is

136
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
looking at AI now in a different way.

137
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
And I think AI growth is going to be

138
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,080
exponential. So, anything to do with AI

139
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
now, what could that be? In the simplest

140
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,280
form, it's helping people use the

141
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,000
technology. There's going to be a

142
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
massive amount of people wanting to use

143
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,040
it that don't know how to and they're

144
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
willing to pay to solve that painoint.

145
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,680
So, is that consulting? Not really. is

146
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,600
implementation and execution. And so

147
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
helping a business do that transfer into

148
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
a world where they're controlling their

149
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,759
data and getting information from it.

150
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
Now, the majority of businesses in

151
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
America, for example, are between 5 and

152
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,160
500 employees. So, they're small

153
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,960
businesses. They create 62% of the jobs.

154
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,040
They want to use AI. You should help

155
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,800
them solve for that, and they'll pay

156
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,720
you. Did you catch that? Let's see what

157
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,320
Mark Cuban has to say as well. The

158
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,400
skills you need for a job today, 10

159
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
years, 100 years from now are always the

160
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,080
same. You need to be curious because

161
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,919
everything's changing. You need to be

162
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,400
agile because everything's changing. And

163
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
you've got to be able to adapt because

164
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
everything's always changing. I can

165
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,639
pretend that I'm going to be able to

166
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,240
predict where AI is going and the exact

167
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,000
impact on the job market, but I'd be

168
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,240
lying. I have no idea. But I do know

169
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,000
that I'm going to pay attention and be

170
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,080
agile and be curious and be able to

171
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,160
adapt. So, if I was a 16-year-old kid

172
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
and I needed to start a side hustle to

173
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
make some money, there's a couple things

174
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,960
that I would do. One, I would be all in

175
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,520
on large language models like Chat GPT

176
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,639
and Gemini, Meta, and the like and

177
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,880
learning how to prompt and going to my

178
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,639
friends and teaching them how to do

179
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,280
prompts for all their papers. And then I

180
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,600
would go to businesses because

181
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,960
businesses, particularly small to

182
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,639
medium-sized businesses, don't

183
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
understand AI yet. And I doesn't matter

184
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,199
if I'm 16, I'd be teaching them as well.

185
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,360
Think you got it? Well, hold that

186
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
thought. And now, let me show you

187
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,840
something from nearly two years ago. AI

188
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919
automation agencies are the next big

189
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,000
thing in online business. The AI

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,919
automation agency model is an online

191
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,080
business model focused on helping small

192
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
to mediumsiz businesses to automate

193
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
their systems and processes with AI

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
technology. What I'm calling an AI

195
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
automation agency is an online business

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
model where you work with businesses

197
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,919
either on a contract or retainer basis

198
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,240
to help them apply AI technologies. That

199
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,120
video was filmed in May of 2023. And

200
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
what I discovered back then through my

201
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,800
own business, Morningside AI. And what

202
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
these billionaires are are really only

203
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
just catching on to now is that there is

204
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,280
an enormous gap between these small to

205
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,039
mediumsiz businesses that desperately

206
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,000
need AI to stay competitive and their

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,080
ability to actually implement it. For

208
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,919
these businesses to be fully up to date

209
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,919
with AI, there are many layers of

210
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,440
services that they are starving for

211
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
right now. You've got education about

212
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,000
what AI is as a technology and what it

213
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,759
can and can't do. Secondly, they are

214
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,360
starving for consulting on the best

215
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,599
kinds of AI systems to implement for

216
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,599
their business to get some kind of ROI.

217
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
And the final step is building AI

218
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,800
systems for them in order to reduce

219
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
their costs and increase their sales.

220
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,479
The businesses that provide these kinds

221
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
of AI services and what these rich guys

222
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
keep talking about are called AI

223
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
automation. agencies or AAA's for short,

224
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,199
which is a term that my team and I

225
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,440
created to really describe a new

226
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
business model that we discovered in May

227
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
of 2023. Now, before you click away

228
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,280
thinking that I can't do this, I'm I

229
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,440
don't know AI. I'm not an expert in AI.

230
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,599
I'm not qualified. Give me a second and

231
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,000
I will destroy every single excuse and

232
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,919
shred of self-doubt that your brain is

233
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,039
creating right now about this

234
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,199
opportunity. In reality, you are so much

235
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,280
closer to tapping into this enormous

236
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,880
demand for AI services that these

237
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,800
billionaires keep talking about than you

238
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
think. Starting off with excuse number

239
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,599
one, I'm not an AI expert. So, this

240
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,319
right here, this belief that you need to

241
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,800
be some kind of AI expert with a degree

242
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
or other qualifications is exactly why

243
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
this opportunity is still so untapped.

244
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
What most people don't understand about

245
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,199
the current AI revolution is that when

246
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,560
chat GPD was launched in in the end of

247
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,160
2022, it basically blindsided everyone

248
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,720
equally, right? So the AI academics,

249
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
business leaders, even the tech giants

250
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,120
like Google, this new wave of AI is so

251
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,960
different from what came before it and

252
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,120
so transformative that we are all

253
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
essentially starting from ground zero.

254
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,320
It truly is an even playing field. And

255
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
while universities and traditional

256
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,880
education are still scrambling to update

257
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,559
their courses and programs, while

258
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,080
businesses are still desperate to

259
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,640
understand what's possible with this

260
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,760
technology, there's been a small group

261
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,839
of people that have been stepping up in

262
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,000
order to bridge this gap and start to

263
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
tap into this surging demand from

264
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,839
businesses all over the world for AI

265
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,519
services. And the thing is that they're

266
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,000
not AI academics. The majority of them

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
aren't even developers. that the regular

268
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,399
people who saw this opportunity like the

269
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,240
billionaires and and myself and and just

270
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
took action on it. My point here is that

271
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,279
the real experts in AI for businesses

272
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
aren't being created in classrooms. They

273
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,519
are being forged in the real world by

274
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,200
helping businesses to understand and

275
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,880
adopt this technology in a place where

276
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,519
we are judged by our results and not by

277
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,839
our qualifications. You don't need to be

278
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,320
a technical genius to get into AI.

279
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
Businesses need three things. They need

280
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,399
someone to explain AI to them in simple

281
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,240
terms. That's education. They need

282
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,920
someone to show them how and where to

283
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
use it. That's consulting. And finally,

284
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,440
they need someone to help them implement

285
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
it into their business. So, you don't

286
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,399
have to do all three. You can literally

287
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
just start wherever suits you best

288
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,120
depending on your background. And I'll

289
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,800
explain the process for doing this in

290
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
the last section of this video. But to

291
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,839
get started, you could literally just

292
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,519
take what you learn in my videos about

293
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,360
AI agents, for example. I did a massive

294
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
video on that. you could turn that video

295
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,560
and the information in it into a

296
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
presentation and start helping

297
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,399
businesses to understand AI agents in

298
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,240
the future of work uh within the next

299
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,399
few days. The bar to get into AI isn't

300
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,000
necessarily having all of the answers

301
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
right away. It's really just about being

302
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
one step ahead of the businesses who

303
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
don't have the time to figure this stuff

304
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
out themselves. Excuse number two is I

305
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,399
can't code. Now, this is the second most

306
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,560
common excuse I hear of, I can't get

307
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,880
into AI. I don't know how to code. And I

308
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
I totally get where this comes from,

309
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,480
especially when I talk about AI

310
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,959
automation and and building AI systems

311
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
and that stuff really immediately

312
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
terrifies people and for good reason.

313
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,240
But let me share something about what

314
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,399
I've learned really firsthand at my

315
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,079
agency, Morningside AI. Before

316
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,079
businesses even think of signing off on

317
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,880
a $50,000 AI development project, they

318
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,040
first need two things solved. They need

319
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,959
someone to help them understand what AI

320
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,200
actually is. and they need someone to

321
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,279
show them where AI can drive the biggest

322
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,480
ROI within their business. And so this

323
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,640
is great news for you non-coders and

324
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
people who don't want to be technical.

325
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,519
You can always learn, but some people

326
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,800
just really don't want to do that. And I

327
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,880
get that and understand it. But it's

328
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,240
great news for you because there's huge

329
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
amounts of money to be made in this

330
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,480
education and consulting space in the AI

331
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,839
services market. Now, if you don't

332
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,519
believe me, don't take my word for it.

333
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
Just look at what all of the biggest

334
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,200
consultings in the world are doing.

335
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,880
You've got McKenzie, which has just

336
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,839
combined 1,000 AI experts into their new

337
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,240
quantum black AI division. Accenture is

338
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,200
dropping $3 billion on new staff in

339
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,800
order to expand the AI consulting

340
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,680
division. And BCG expects AI consulting

341
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
to make up almost half of what they do

342
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,959
by 2026. But while these consulting

343
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,560
giants are fighting over these Fortune

344
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,959
500 companies, the businesses that Ori

345
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,480
mentioned in the clip I played, the ones

346
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
that make up 62% of US jobs are being

347
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,279
completely ignored. and they are

348
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,120
desperate for guides to help them make

349
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,279
this transition into the AI age just as

350
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,880
much as the big companies. Now, I would

351
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,399
be talking out of my ass if I didn't

352
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,000
have some good examples of non-coders

353
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
who had actually transitioned out of

354
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
their previous career into the AI space.

355
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,519
So, let me introduce you to three very

356
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,279
different people who found their lane in

357
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,200
the AI space without having a technical

358
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,279
background. Firstly, there is Nick. And

359
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,800
so, a year ago, he was a successful

360
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,399
strategy consultant, but was completely

361
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,240
new to AI and had never written a line

362
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
of code in his life. But like many

363
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
consultants, he was great at spotting

364
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,079
opportunities and explaining complex

365
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,920
ideas. He joined my AAA accelerator

366
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,600
program and built up his AI knowledge

367
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
and started sharing his AI insights on

368
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
LinkedIn, building his personal brand

369
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,800
while learning about the space as a

370
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320
whole. Within a few months, he had his

371
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,480
own AI automation agency up and running.

372
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,079
Today, he's leading our consulting

373
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,160
division at Morningside AI, where we've

374
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,399
just completed an 8-week AI audit for a

375
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,040
$200 million per year steel company. And

376
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,120
so Nick's gone from complete AI beginner

377
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,680
to closing huge AI consulting deals in

378
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
just over a year. Then there's Henrik.

379
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,800
And so when he joined my community

380
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,880
nearly 2 years ago, he knew nothing

381
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,519
about AI or coding, but he was willing

382
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,880
to learn. I had to have to give it to

383
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,160
him. He was willing to learn and stick

384
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
it out. And he started with simple no

385
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,240
code tools uh for AI automations and he

386
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,519
kept pushing himself just a little bit

387
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,519
at a time. And now he's one of the most

388
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,600
experienced voice AI developers globally

389
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
and he's building voice agents for major

390
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,360
businesses. And better yet, he's just

391
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
hit his goal of $15,000 in a single

392
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
month and he's just had a baby. So,

393
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,959
massive congrats, Henrik. It's been

394
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,079
awesome to see your growth, man. And

395
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
finally, there's Isaiah. And he was one

396
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
of my earliest community members. And he

397
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,360
already had strong relationships in the

398
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,200
coaching industry. And so, instead of

399
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
trying to learn all the technical stuff

400
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,040
himself, he got smart, and he focused on

401
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,800
what he was actually really good at

402
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,320
doing already, which is understanding

403
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,399
the market, understanding who he was

404
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,000
trying to sell to and selling these

405
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
solutions to them. And so he found a

406
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,839
technical partner to handle the building

407
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,160
of the solutions that he sells while he

408
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
focused on sales. And now he's doing

409
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,160
$25,000 months helping coaches to

410
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
implement AI appointment setting systems

411
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
into their business without writing a

412
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
single line of code himself. So three

413
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
completely different backgrounds, three

414
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,600
completely different approaches, but one

415
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,760
common thread. They all found their

416
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
perfect entry into the AI services

417
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,600
space. See, this is the beauty of this

418
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,360
AI services space is that you can start

419
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,200
wherever you're comfortable. Whether

420
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,959
it's with education and teaching

421
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,040
businesses to understand AI, it's

422
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,320
consulting and helping find the best

423
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,639
opportunities or yes even development if

424
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,600
you're coming with a technical

425
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,880
background or you're just really

426
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,079
interested and want to learn that side

427
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,760
of the business yourself as I've done

428
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,199
and I really really enjoy getting my

429
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,040
hands dirty and building automations

430
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,800
myself. But thankfully I do have a team

431
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
to do it now at scale. Excuse number

432
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
three is I've never run a business

433
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,399
before. So I'm not going to sugarcoat

434
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,240
this. Starting your first business is

435
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
always going to be hard. I'm not going

436
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,399
to do that to you. But there is a way to

437
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,040
essentially game the system. And it all

438
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,079
comes down to boats. Not fishing boats,

439
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,480
not sailing boats, but rather a boat or

440
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
the business vehicle that you choose to

441
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
get into. This analogy of boats and

442
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,800
business vehicles comes directly from

443
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,320
the world's greatest investor, Warren

444
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,639
Buffett. And no one can explain the

445
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,440
story better than good old Alexi. Warren

446
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
Buffett. Uncle Warren. He and one of his

447
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,639
closest friends graduated Columbia

448
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,839
Business School at the same time, same

449
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,199
year. and he said that guy was smarter

450
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,720
and harder working than him. They then

451
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,160
went their separate ways. Warren ended

452
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
up getting into investing and his friend

453
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,360
goes into the steel business. Mind you,

454
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,959
this is a guy who was smarter and harder

455
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,800
working than him. He said he did okay.

456
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
He did pretty well, but not close to

457
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,120
what Warren did. And he said his biggest

458
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
lesson from that was it's not about how

459
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
hard you row, it's about what boat

460
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,560
you're at. Warren got more out for what

461
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,720
he put in than his buddy in the steel

462
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,000
business because the steel business had

463
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,839
a lot of headwinds. And so he had to row

464
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,639
harder against the wind than Warren did

465
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,959
while riding one of the best growth

466
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,279
curves of the US economy overall. So

467
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,600
it's your choice of boat, the industry

468
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,680
and the business model that you choose

469
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,440
that is the biggest factor in your

470
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
success as an entrepreneur. Let's say

471
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,360
you were to start a business right now

472
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,519
in the newspaper industry. You're going

473
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,120
to be facing some pretty damn brutal

474
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,639
headwinds, right? It's a declining

475
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,560
industry. It's nearly impossible to

476
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
succeed in that industry, especially if

477
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
you're coming in as a beginner. But for

478
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
AI services, not only are you catching

479
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,519
what Bay & Company reports is going to

480
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,240
be an $8 trillion wave of investment in

481
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,480
AI and automation over the next decade,

482
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,839
which I mean we're already starting to

483
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,839
see now in the US, you're also catching

484
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,160
this wave right at the beginning where

485
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,600
basically all of the money is going to

486
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,199
be made. And personally, I learned this

487
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
lesson about picking the right boat the

488
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,120
hard way. As uh my first online business

489
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,759
was in 2019, I started drop shipping as

490
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,360
basically everyone did back then. and I

491
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,800
was pretty late to the party and I

492
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
really realized quickly that I was

493
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,680
fighting over the crumbs left by the

494
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,600
other guys. Long story short, it took me

495
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,079
14 months of failure before I made my

496
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,000
first dollar of profit. Um, I then went

497
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
on to thankfully make good money in the

498
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,199
e-commerce and digital marketing space.

499
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,600
And then in 2023, I decided to switch my

500
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,160
efforts into AI and applied the exact

501
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
same amount of effort and my career has

502
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
just exploded since. So basically,

503
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,639
picking the right boat at the right time

504
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,279
is a multiplier on the time and effort

505
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,800
that you put into it. So starting your

506
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,560
first business in this rapidly growing

507
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,160
space for AI services and the AI

508
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,639
industry as a whole and going with the

509
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,720
wind basically allows you to get bigger

510
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
results faster than normal. Again, I'm

511
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,320
not saying this is going to be dead easy

512
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
or walk in the park, but you will get

513
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
better results at a faster rate when

514
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,120
compared to stagnant and even declining

515
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,399
industries. And what's great about the

516
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,160
AI services space is that you can start

517
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
incredibly small. You can help one

518
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
business to understand AI tools. You can

519
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,559
do it for free at first. Then you can

520
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,079
start charging for your time when you do

521
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,520
this kind of service. Then you can

522
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,039
gradually grow into bigger and bigger

523
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
projects as your confidence builds. Then

524
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,599
transition into a proper AI automation

525
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,760
agency model. And that's basically what

526
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
I did. I started here on YouTube making

527
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,679
videos because I was interested in the

528
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,439
space, making like coding tutorials,

529
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,640
showing you how I was building these

530
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,079
different systems. And then when people

531
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,679
started asking for it, I started to

532
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,599
offer paid consulting calls and

533
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,760
monetized my AI skill set that way

534
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,679
first. Then I started my AI automation

535
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,360
agency. Then I built an education

536
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
business. And then I built an entire AI

537
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,520
SAS as well. As you can see, baby steps

538
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,840
lead to like rapidly lead to really big

539
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
outcomes in a growing industry like AI,

540
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
even if you're new to business. I'm I've

541
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,840
had a few years in the game, thankfully.

542
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,280
But this is not to say that you can't

543
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
achieve similar things, at least on a

544
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
longer time. So baby steps can really

545
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
lead to some pretty big outcomes rapidly

546
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,520
if you're in a growing industry like AI,

547
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,200
even if you're new to business. Excuse

548
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
number four is that I don't have time.

549
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,919
So 1 hour per day that is it that is all

550
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,600
you need to start building your AI

551
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
knowledge and your skills. That's really

552
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
the core of getting this thing off the

553
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
ground and any kind of AI services. Now

554
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,720
of course if you do more than an hour a

555
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,160
day you will get where you want to go

556
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,640
faster. But if you have time constraints

557
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
this is really all you need. I've got a

558
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,400
complete free course on my school

559
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
community that's 100% free. Walks you

560
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,360
through everything you need to know

561
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
about AI business from theory to

562
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,120
building AI automations and agents. So,

563
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,280
if you've got a job and or a busy home

564
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,160
life, then just chipping away at valuep

565
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
packed content like this over a month or

566
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
two or even three will really do

567
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
wonders. And before you know it, you're

568
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,039
going to know more than the majority of

569
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
businesses do when it comes to AI. And

570
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
you can start to make money by profiting

571
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,720
from that knowledge gap between where

572
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,160
you are and where they businesses. And

573
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,520
the beauty of this is that you can do it

574
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
around your current job and lifestyle

575
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,799
until you're ready to take it to the

576
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,559
next level and go all in. Excuse number

577
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,480
five is I'm too late. I've missed the

578
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,799
boat already. Now, this is the final

579
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
excuse I hear from people after I've

580
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,360
taken them through all the stuff I've

581
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,200
just done with you. They get to this and

582
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
they say they point to me and they point

583
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,400
to the kind of first generation of these

584
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
AI service providers and AI automation

585
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
agency owners who've been we've been

586
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,600
really working on this stuff for the

587
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
past 2 years and they use that as the

588
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,280
evidence that they've missed the boat

589
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,120
and we've just kind of soaked up all the

590
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,799
all the market share and that all the

591
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,960
easy gains are going to be gone. Um, and

592
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,240
you may see the kind of views that I get

593
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
on my videos and think that the whole

594
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,760
globe is all over this opportunity by

595
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,840
now. But in reality, 99, maybe even

596
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,280
99.9% of the people who watch my videos

597
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,520
don't actually take action. And of those

598
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,600
who do, only a fraction of those people

599
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
actually commit to the process and the

600
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
grind and the ups and the downs actually

601
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,520
needed to see success and build a

602
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
long-term sustainable agency. But right

603
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
now, if you looked at the demand for AI

604
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
services versus the supply, there would

605
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,520
be a staggering shortage on the supply

606
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,480
side. According to the NICS 2024 data,

607
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,120
there are 1.7 million companies in the

608
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,200
United States alone with annual revenues

609
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
between 500,000 and 10 million. MyA

610
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,919
accelerator program has trained 2,000

611
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,880
active agencies, 60% of which are USA

612
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
based. Active meaning that they are

613
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
basically consistently closing deals and

614
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
capable of providing quality services.

615
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,160
And when you factor in the older and

616
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,679
traditional development agencies that

617
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,520
have since seen the AI opportunity and

618
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,320
pivoted in into these AI services, we're

619
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,520
looking at 1500 or so active AI agencies

620
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
in the USA. That means that for every

621
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
active AI automation agency in the US,

622
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,919
there are

623
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,679
1,133 small businesses needing help with

624
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,440
their AI transition. And that's only for

625
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
businesses that are doing less than 10

626
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,640
million per year. So to put things in

627
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
perspective, according to Satista, there

628
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,360
are approximately

629
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,280
54,220 digital advertising agencies in

630
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,679
the United States in 2023. That means

631
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,480
that there are 31 small businesses per

632
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,559
digital agency in the United States. So

633
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,640
1,133 to1 in the AI agency space and

634
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,559
then 31 to1 in the digital marketing

635
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,720
space. So when people say SMMA is

636
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,640
saturated, like it really really is when

637
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,760
you look at these kind of numbers. And

638
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,360
the digital marketing space only really

639
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
kicked off in the early 2000s when

640
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,799
Google released their search ads

641
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,400
platform AdSense. So it has taken

642
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
basically 25 years for it to reach this

643
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,799
level of saturation. I only created the

644
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,799
AI automation agency model and started

645
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,360
talking about it in May of 2023. So even

646
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,799
if the space takes off and everyone

647
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,159
starts listening to the billionaire's

648
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,240
advice, it's at least another five or

649
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
more years on the conservative side

650
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,760
before things become anywhere near as

651
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,080
competitive as digital marketing as this

652
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
ratio of agencies to businesses starts

653
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,760
to come down. If you start now, by the

654
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,120
time we get to that point, you'll have

655
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,559
been able to build your skills, build

656
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,320
your team, and really become the master

657
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,400
of your niche, while the newbies

658
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,919
struggle to get in at this later point.

659
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,520
In the final section of this video, I'll

660
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,960
break down the process of starting your

661
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,679
own AI services business step by step.

662
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,280
So, in short, we're still so early to

663
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,679
this, and AI will continue to change and

664
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,679
advance rapidly, meaning that businesses

665
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,360
will become more and more dependent on

666
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
us to help them navigate this long

667
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,799
period of transition when there's new

668
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,400
technologies coming out here and there.

669
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
So, what I'm trying to say is there's a

670
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,919
long way to go. By this point, it should

671
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,159
be pretty clear. The only thing stopping

672
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,559
you from transitioning into the AI space

673
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,880
is you, right? The reason we're seeing

674
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
success stories from such diverse

675
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
backgrounds is simple. And it goes back

676
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,640
to what Warren Buffett said. It's not

677
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,039
about how hard you row. It's about the

678
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,640
boat you're in. Before I show you

679
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,080
exactly how to start one of these

680
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,360
businesses and give you all of the

681
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,480
resources and help you're going to need

682
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
along the way, let me prove once and for

683
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,880
all why this is by far the best boat on

684
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,640
the market right now. And I'm going to

685
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,320
do so with a little help from the

686
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,400
greatest teacher of all,

687
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,840
history. To truly understand why the

688
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
billionaires are begging you to start AI

689
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
automation agencies, let me take you

690
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,799
back to 1995. The internet had just

691
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,880
become commercially available and most

692
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
people thought it was a fad. Business

693
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,159
owners were confused. They were

694
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,000
skeptical and many thought that having a

695
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
website was going to be pointless. Sound

696
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,760
familiar? But just like today with AI,

697
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,600
businesses knew something big was

698
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,240
coming. But they had no idea how to take

699
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,840
advantage of it. And this created an

700
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,520
incredible opportunity for smart

701
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,480
entrepreneurs to bridge this gap and

702
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,080
make ridiculous amounts of money while

703
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,280
doing so. Take agency.com for example.

704
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,039
They started pretty simple. They started

705
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
helping businesses to establish their

706
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,080
first web presence, doing basic website

707
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,240
design and development and digital

708
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,799
consulting to basically explain what was

709
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,200
possible with the web for a business. As

710
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,120
businesses began to understand the web,

711
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,919
they expanded into strategic consulting,

712
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,000
e-commerce implementation, digital

713
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,760
marketing services, etc. And this

714
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
company was founded in 1995 in New York

715
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,880
City. And by 1999, just four years

716
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,679
later, they were worth $2 billion and

717
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,120
were working with giants like British

718
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,200
Airways, Nike, and Sprint. Or look at

719
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,840
Razerfish. They started with just $3,000

720
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,480
in startup capital as basically a small

721
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,640
digital design and web development shop,

722
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400
but they quickly evolved into something

723
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,559
much, much bigger. They helped these

724
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,720
traditional businesses to transform for

725
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
the digital age through things like

726
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,559
digital strategy consulting, custom

727
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,559
software development, and e-commerce

728
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,400
platforms. At the time, Razer Fish's

729
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
business grew rapidly from $300,000 in

730
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,919
revenue in 1995 to $268 million in

731
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,480
revenue by 2000, just 5 years later,

732
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,360
with over 2,300 employees across nine

733
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,720
countries. Now, here's what most people

734
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,559
miss about these stories. It wasn't just

735
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,919
that they were early to the web and

736
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,360
that's how they made all this money.

737
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,320
It's that they position themselves as

738
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,919
guides helping these confused businesses

739
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,919
to navigate this new technology. In

740
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,440
1995, it was what is a website and do I

741
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,440
need one? And 2025, it's what is AI and

742
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
how can it help my business? But here's

743
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,799
what makes this opportunity even more

744
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,279
incredible. Unlike the '90s when the

745
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,120
internet boom was only really accessible

746
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,679
to a tiny group of computer enthusiasts

747
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,080
who knew how to code at the time, this

748
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,559
time around, we have the world's

749
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,559
information at our fingertips via

750
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,360
Google, YouTube, and Chat GBT. We have

751
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,200
thriving online communities of people

752
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,960
who are building cool stuff with AI and

753
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,559
collaborating with each other. And there

754
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,880
are incredible lowcost tools that allow

755
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,279
basically anyone to build AI systems and

756
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,279
automations without coding. And I mean,

757
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,520
if those aren't enough, generative AI

758
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,360
technology itself is based on something

759
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,440
that we all know how to do or can easily

760
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
learn, which is just writing clear

761
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,360
instructions. I mean, that's all AI

762
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,279
prompting really is. It's built on

763
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,159
written

764
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,720
language. So my question to you is this.

765
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,279
If not now, then when? If you're not

766
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,720
satisfied with your current situation,

767
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
if you believe deep down that you

768
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,640
deserve more from life, what other signs

769
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
are you waiting for? I mean, we have

770
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
billionaires literally saying, "If I was

771
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,559
starting over again, this is exactly

772
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,200
what I'd be doing." We have mountains of

773
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,039
data showing that businesses and

774
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
governments are about to pour trillions

775
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,120
and trillions into the AI transition.

776
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,279
We've just got a new presidency in

777
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,360
America with a very, very pro- AAI

778
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,120
administration. So, we have another

779
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,720
four-year runway that's going to be all

780
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,400
about AI and and all sort of positive

781
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,320
wins about our back. We have an industry

782
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
that is so diverse that whether you want

783
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,720
to sell many courses to small businesses

784
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,279
and make 20K a month or build seven

785
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,960
figure AI automation systems for

786
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
enterprises. There's a place for you and

787
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,240
there's a place for everyone. And we

788
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,600
have proof. We have thousands of people

789
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,360
from all walks of life who have made

790
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,799
this jump into the AI space and

791
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,320
succeeded. I've got them all in my

792
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,520
communities. I've got them here on the

793
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,279
channel. Hell, I've even documented my

794
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,360
entire journey on this channel from day

795
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,200
one from complete beginner to where we

796
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,960
are now in order to show you how to do

797
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
it or at least how it worked for me. And

798
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,559
I get passionate about this because AI

799
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,480
truly has blessed me beyond my wildest

800
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,840
dreams. And that sounds kind of cringe

801
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,760
to say, but it seriously allowed me to

802
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,840
make more money than I ever ever

803
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,000
imagined possible to build an incredible

804
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,159
company alongside my best friends to

805
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,919
find a way to truly feel like I'm

806
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,600
impacting the world. And that's why I

807
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,279
feel kind of this burning responsibility

808
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,120
to grab you by the shoulders and scream

809
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,039
like this is it man. This this is the

810
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,480
opportunity that you've been waiting

811
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,240
for. If you've ever been praying or

812
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,080
whatever religion you believe in asking

813
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,600
for something to come and and come your

814
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,960
way like this is it. This is it. I have

815
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,880
all of my friends who run successful

816
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,159
businesses. They talk to me and they

817
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,240
say, "Man, I'm so like I just wish I had

818
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,919
this kind of I wish that was the vehicle

819
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,520
or that was the opportunity that I got

820
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,600
into. It's just I can't shift now, but I

821
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,760
wish I wish if in another life I would

822
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
have done the exact same thing as you.

823
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,799
And so if these really successful

824
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,240
businessmen who are running different

825
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
businesses looking in at me and other

826
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
people who do this stuff like me and

827
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,039
they are like, "Wow, I wish I had that

828
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,880
chance." Then I'm telling you, if you

829
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,480
want to get into business, then just

830
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,960
just there's something here for you. And

831
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,480
this is like why I make these videos

832
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,400
just to make a bit of awareness so that

833
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,480
you have some kind of stimulus to take

834
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,240
action on it. Because I promise you,

835
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
there's something in here for everyone.

836
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,360
And I found mine, I see so many other

837
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,679
people do it, too. I just really want to

838
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,799
create awareness around this whole

839
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,960
thing. And so, if you are ready to take

840
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
the first step towards the life that

841
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,799
you've always dreamed of, let me show

842
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,120
you exactly how to get started in this

843
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,240
today. Now, for the bit you've all been

844
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
waiting for. I've explained the

845
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
opportunity at hand. I've explained why

846
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,679
these billionaires won't shut up about

847
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,360
it. And I've demolished all of your

848
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,039
self-doubt and excuses that will stop

849
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,480
you and prevent you from taking the

850
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,720
dive. I've outlined the crystal clear

851
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,240
historical pattern that this model is

852
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,600
based on and really tried to cut through

853
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,240
this AI hype rubbish that we get to like

854
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,080
some historical patterns and precedents

855
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,600
that we can base it off and be like,

856
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,120
"Okay, we can expect something similar

857
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,799
here. I'm trying to make this not some

858
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,520
AI fluffy hype stuff, but really really

859
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
databacked for you cuz I know there's a

860
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,240
lot of people who need to see that." And

861
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,760
most importantly, I've just challenged

862
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,320
you to take action because if not now,

863
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
then when? If you're still here watching

864
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,600
this video, then you understand that

865
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
while this isn't going to be easy, like

866
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,440
I said, it's about as easy as it'll ever

867
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,520
get, and you're obviously going to be

868
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,440
ready to put the work in. So, let's get

869
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,840
into it.

870
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,679
Now, while everyone's journey into AI is

871
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,440
of course different, through my own

872
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,880
experience of starting my own AI

873
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,559
businesses and helping thousands to do

874
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,840
the same through my free and paid

875
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,080
communities, I've got enough data on

876
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,440
what works and what doesn't. And it's

877
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,279
basically revealed a sequence of

878
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,440
non-negotiable steps in order to be

879
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,120
successful in the space. And to give you

880
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,799
a clear step-by-step approach to

881
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,039
executing on these non-negotiable steps,

882
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,120
I've created my most comprehensive free

883
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,279
guide on starting an AI business to

884
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,760
date, which breaks down this process and

885
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
provides access to all of the my best

886
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,000
resources, including those from my paid

887
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
AAA accelerator program as well. This

888
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,799
complete guide is going to be available

889
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,559
for free via the first link in the

890
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,080
description. But for the rest of this

891
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,520
video, I want to give you a detailed

892
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,559
breakdown of each of these

893
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,159
non-negotiable steps so that you're

894
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,760
ready to take action on that document

895
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,320
below.

896
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,080
So step number one in starting your AI

897
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,760
business is finding your unfair

898
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,600
advantage. Business is all about finding

899
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,279
your unique edge and playing that

900
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,880
advantage fully. After watching

901
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,559
thousands of people start their AI

902
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,240
journey through my communities, I can

903
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,559
tell you that without a doubt, this step

904
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,480
is what makes or breaks the majority of

905
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
people's success. It's basically picking

906
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
the right niche and starting point for

907
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,640
their business where they have a natural

908
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,480
upper hand. So, as part of the complete

909
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,760
guide in the description, I'm going to

910
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,679
be giving you free access to the exact

911
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,840
resource that I use for all of my AAA

912
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,440
accelerator members within my program,

913
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
which is basically a comprehensive self-

914
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,200
audit that uncovers your past

915
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,720
experiences, your interests, your

916
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,559
connections, your relationships. And

917
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,080
from this self- audit, you're able to

918
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,840
find a starting point where you have a

919
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,600
unique advantage. I've seen people from

920
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
every background imaginable succeed.

921
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,039
from ex-conultants to even miners, but

922
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,720
only when they lean into their unique

923
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,559
advantages instead of trying to copy

924
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,440
someone else's

925
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,799
path. Step two is to build your

926
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,399
knowledge gap. Your knowledge gap is

927
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,480
your money maker in the AI space or in

928
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,000
any space really for that matter. It's

929
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,919
pretty simple really. Your clients are

930
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,919
going to pay you in proportion to how

931
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,000
much more you know about AI and its

932
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,840
business applications than they do. So,

933
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,080
it's a knowledge gap. They are here. You

934
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,960
are here. The beautiful thing about 2025

935
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
is that the knowledge to acquire your

936
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,200
own knowledge gap is everywhere. You can

937
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,960
build this gap through free resources

938
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,799
like here on my YouTube channel and my

939
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,640
free course on my school community. Or

940
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
you can accelerate your learning through

941
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,279
paid programs that offer more

942
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,039
concentrated and structured information

943
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,640
if you have the funds to do so. But in

944
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,919
the complete guide below, I've provided

945
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,760
you with a list of my best free

946
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,919
resources in order to rapidly build your

947
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,960
own knowledge

948
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,399
gap. Step three is finding your first

949
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,880
free clients. So, it's crucial to ease

950
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,600
into selling AI services. You can't eat

951
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,200
an elephant in one bite, I think, is how

952
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,960
they'd probably say it. But, we aren't

953
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,799
in a rush here, right? If you start now

954
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,039
and take your time focusing on just

955
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,559
building your skills and truly

956
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,480
satisfying your clients, you'll find

957
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
your feet and build a solid base to

958
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,720
scale from there. I mean, I see it way

959
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,200
too often and people try to jump into

960
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,799
this business model and try to deliver

961
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,720
some $10,000 deal and they just

962
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
completely butcher it. Maybe often times

963
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,399
it's with a a a good friend or a

964
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,000
connection that they have and they just

965
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
butcher the project, which is completely

966
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,279
normal. I mean, your first project is

967
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,440
always going to be the hardest, but this

968
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,039
experience gives them a bad taste in

969
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,720
their mouth and they end up giving up on

970
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,399
their business model entirely based off

971
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,159
this first experience because they bit

972
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,600
off more than they could chew. So, I

973
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
always recommend starting with free

974
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,679
clients initially so you can start just

975
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,600
restacking small wins and gradually

976
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,200
building momentum, building your

977
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,519
confidence. So, by far the best way to

978
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,440
get your first free clients and start to

979
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,360
build this confidence and momentum is by

980
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,039
tapping into your warm connection. So,

981
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,720
that's your friends, your colleagues,

982
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,360
your acquaintances, family, etc. People

983
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,880
that you have some kind of relationship

984
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,080
or connection with. In the complete

985
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,279
guide I've linked in the description,

986
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,039
I've included the exact process again

987
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,960
used by my accelerated members to

988
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,799
systematically reach out to warm

989
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,960
connections and the spreadsheets we use

990
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
to track follow-ups and replies and also

991
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,159
to sign deals.

992
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,159
Step four is scaling with content or

993
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,159
ads. A key step that many AAA owners

994
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,840
stumble at is transitioning from their

995
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,159
first few warm connectionsbased projects

996
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,000
to actually consistently generating

997
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,919
leads from other sources. And this is

998
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,159
where your business either takes off or

999
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,760
it hits a plateau. So you need a

1000
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
systematic way to attract new clients

1001
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,519
whether through content marketing like

1002
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,519
YouTube videos like this or through paid

1003
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,519
advertising. I mean both approaches

1004
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,120
work. It's about choosing one that

1005
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,640
aligns with your strengths and your

1006
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,279
resources. At Morningside AI, my AI

1007
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,279
automation agency, we've never had an

1008
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,960
issue with leads because this channel

1009
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
here gets over a million views per month

1010
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,559
and brings in many, many times more

1011
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,559
leads than we can handle. Like, even if

1012
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,240
we tried, which is a massive part of our

1013
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,919
success as an agency. And so, in the

1014
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,600
complete guide in the description below,

1015
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,039
I will provide the step-by-step

1016
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,960
blueprints for creating your own lead

1017
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,640
generation machine using the exact

1018
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,399
content creation strategy that has

1019
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,640
worked for me and my most successful

1020
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,480
students. Step five is building a team.

1021
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,559
So finally, the real key to scale is

1022
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,080
building an incredible team around you

1023
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,600
so that you can spend time building the

1024
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
business rather than working on it every

1025
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,960
day. I could not have achieved a

1026
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
fraction of what I have over the past 2

1027
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,039
years without my incredible teams across

1028
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,480
all of my different businesses. There

1029
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
are a few key highs that you make at

1030
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,159
certain stages of growth in your AI

1031
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,399
automation agency journey. From your

1032
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,840
first virtual assistant to take things

1033
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,679
off your plate to project managers and

1034
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,200
key developer roles as well. In the

1035
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,559
complete guide below, I've broken down

1036
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,720
in detail exactly when to make these

1037
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
hires and provided instructions on how

1038
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,799
to find and how to hire the best people

1039
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,399
for these roles. This is basically what

1040
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,840
transforms your business from a

1041
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,440
high-paying job into a truly scalable

1042
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,039
enterprise. So, that's it. Five steps

1043
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,359
between you and building your boat

1044
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,119
that's perfectly positioned to ride the

1045
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,679
waves of this coming decade so that

1046
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,520
basically at the end of the day, you can

1047
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,119
get more of what you want out of life.

1048
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,879
As I said, I have been blessed beyond my

1049
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,800
wildest dreams by what the AI space has

1050
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,079
given me and entrepreneurship as a

1051
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,239
whole. Not only monetarily, but also the

1052
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,079
feeling of being at the forefront of the

1053
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,520
most important industry in the world

1054
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,079
right now and playing a role in how this

1055
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,079
technology is adopted. Making sure that

1056
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,839
people like you and I can get in and get

1057
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,679
a slice of the action and all the money

1058
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,679
doesn't just go to the big guys. Making

1059
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,839
sure that small businesses have access

1060
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,599
to the AI services that they need in

1061
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,440
order to survive against the big guys

1062
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,879
and making incredible friends and

1063
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,399
memories along the way. as corny as it

1064
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,079
sounds. So whether you just want to get

1065
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,159
into the AI space for the money or you

1066
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,760
want the purpose, the fulfillment, and

1067
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,599
the excitement that comes along with it,

1068
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,159
the AI space has something for everyone.

1069
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,920
There's not enough AI service providers

1070
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,599
to help us make this transition. The

1071
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,839
world needs you to step up to the plate,

1072
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,440
and there'll never be a better time to

1073
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,839
start than now. I am so excited for you

1074
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,680
and the journey that you're about to go

1075

1079
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,240
description below. And I look forward to

1080
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,200
seeing you in my community

1081
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,839
soon. There are tons of AI opportunities

1082
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,680
popping up these days and I've pretty

1083
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,119
much tried all of them personally over

1084
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,280
the past 2 years. So in this section I'm

1085
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,480
going to be breaking down the top five

1086
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,560
AI businesses that complete beginners

1087
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,920
are using right now to launch their

1088
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,839
careers in the AI space and start making

1089
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,440
money. So, as I said, over the past 2

1090
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,599
years, I've personally run or am still

1091
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,200
running all five of the business types

1092
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,640
we're going to cover in this section.

1093
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,160
So, I'm going to be giving you the no

1094
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,920
[ __ ] real world experience and

1095
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,599
insights into the pros and cons of each

1096
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,680
of them and really how much money you

1097
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,119
can expect to make from them. And then

1098
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,400
at the end of the section, I'm going to

1099
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,079
be recapping things and explain which

1100
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,680
business is best for you to start. So,

1101
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,720
let's dive in. First up, we have AI

1102
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,320
influencing. So, here's the deal. People

1103
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,079
are hungry for simple and easy to

1104
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,320
understand info on AI right now. your

1105
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
job as an AI influencer is to take all

1106
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,560
of the complicated stuff about AI, like

1107
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,400
what new tools out there right now and

1108
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,079
how businesses can use them to benefit

1109
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,760
from them, and then explain it in a way

1110
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,839
that anyone can understand. You can kind

1111
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,359
of think of it as being a translator for

1112
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,599
AI, but you're on YouTube or social

1113
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,040
media. And you definitely don't need to

1114
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,960
be a genius. You just need to understand

1115
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
a little bit more than the average

1116
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,000
person or average viewer. And so, you

1117
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,440
can share your insights through videos

1118
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,960
like this on YouTube. You can write

1119
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,119
posts on Twitter or Medium. And if

1120
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,560
people like what you're sharing, then

1121
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,640
you can make money from ads, from

1122
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,480
partnerships, or from promoting other

1123
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,920
people's products as well. So, I started

1124
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,560
out my journey as an AI influencer, as a

1125
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,480
complete newbie to generative AI in

1126
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,400
January of 2023. You can even go back

1127
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,480
and watch all my old videos and see how

1128
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
little I knew about it and how stupid I

1129
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,760
was now that I watch them. It's kind of

1130
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,680
painful to watch them. But within 7

1131
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,119
months of posting consistently, my

1132
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,119
YouTube channel hit 100,000 subscribers,

1133
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,040
which was a shock even to me. But what I

1134
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,240
learned from my growth is that it's in

1135
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,800
these new and such hype spaces that's so

1136
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,720
much easier to grow a large following if

1137
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,560
your content is actually good. And yep,

1138
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,480
the AI influencer model does make a bit

1139
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,079
of money too. You've got ad revenue

1140
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,520
firstly, which is money from ads that

1141
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,280
are run on your YouTube video or on your

1142
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,119
content. Um, you've also got affiliate

1143
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,640
marketing, which is when you get paid

1144
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
for sending signups to things like other

1145
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,320
AI tools that you recommend. And then

1146
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,920
you've got video sponsorships where

1147
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,599
brands pay you to mention their

1148
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,040
products. And so you can start making

1149
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,920
anywhere from $2 to $5,000 per month,

1150
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,680
even with a small audience. But you are

1151
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
going to have to work consistently and

1152
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,800
create highquality content for about 3

1153
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,480
to 6 months before you start seeing any

1154
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,920
meaningful revenue from the business.

1155
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,359
The pros for this model are that you've

1156
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,960
got super low startup costs, just you

1157
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
and a camera. You've got quick growth if

1158
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,480
you pick the right topics like I did in

1159
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,400
the first 7 months, and you only really

1160
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,760
need a phone and a laptop to get

1161
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,440
started. The cons are that it doesn't

1162
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,880
make the big bucks compared to the other

1163
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,560
models we're going to touch on later.

1164
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
Plus, getting on the camera can be a

1165
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,839
pain in the ass if it's really not your

1166
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,000
thing. Um, influencing via YouTube and

1167
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
long form videos like this is by far the

1168
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,680
best. So, if you're not willing to be on

1169
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,119
camera, then you might have to do say

1170
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,960
writing on Medium or Twitter, and it's

1171
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,640
not going to get as good results as long

1172
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,400
form YouTube like this, right? So, next,

1173
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
let's talk AI consulting. So, this is

1174
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,880
where businesses pay you for advice.

1175
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,400
They want to know how AI can make their

1176
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,640
businesses better or what to avoid so

1177
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,160
that they can survive this AI

1178
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
transition. Basically, they're going to

1179
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,920
be paying you to tell them what to do or

1180
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,359
help them understand the new tools that

1181
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,040
are coming out and stay up to date. When

1182
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,400
I was doing this, it felt like I was

1183
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,079
doing AI therapy for some of these

1184
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,359
businesses who are really stressed out

1185
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,960
or they see big opportunities and they

1186
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,320
want to talk to me as kind of an AI

1187
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,000
therapist to get an expert opinion on

1188
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,599
things and soo their nerves. To become

1189
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,960
an AI consultant, you don't need a

1190
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,119
degree or some fancy qualifications. You

1191
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,720
just need to know again a little bit

1192
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,240
more than the businesses that you're

1193
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,000
helping do and be able to explain it

1194
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,680
clearly to them. For example, within the

1195
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,200
first four months of starting my YouTube

1196
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,280
channel, I was pulling in $4,000 a

1197
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,560
month. I think $4,200 in April of 2023

1198
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,640
from my consulting calls alone. So, I

1199
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,720
was charging $300 per call. And I

1200
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,359
eventually jacked that up to $997 for a

1201
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,280
45minute session. And yes, people were

1202
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
buying even at that price as well. So,

1203
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,960
consulting can be a very natural step

1204
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,040
from AI influencing as it's a more

1205
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,640
effective way to monetize your personal

1206
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,480
brand without having to create your own

1207
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,640
products or build your own complicated

1208
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,160
services as well. So, the pros of this

1209
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
model are that it's easy to start. You

1210
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,520
can scale this quickly by raising your

1211
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,880
rates as you get more clients. So, I

1212
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,960
just continually increase my prices as I

1213
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,880
got more demand. And it's a great way to

1214
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,480
build confidence and build real world

1215
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,320
experience of working with clients and

1216
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,920
and helping businesses, which is really

1217
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,119
where the money is in the space right

1218
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,800
now. The cons for the AI consulting

1219
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
model are that you're still really

1220
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,480
trading your time for money. And while

1221
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,640
that can be fine at first, it's not a

1222
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,560
long-term path to wealth. And you're

1223
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
only going to get paid for your time

1224
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,119
that you're actually working. And also,

1225
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,560
I found that consulting wasn't the most

1226
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,720
exhilarating work. If I had my whole day

1227
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,320
booked out with consulting calls, it

1228
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,839
wasn't like exhilarating. I didn't feel

1229
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,280
excited and jumping out of bed to go and

1230
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,800
hop on these calls. So, that's another

1231
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,160
thing to factor in as well. So, now

1232
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,440
we're getting into the serious stuff,

1233
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,920
the AI automation agency or what is

1234
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,079
known for short as the AAA model. This

1235
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,599
is where you get businesses to pay you

1236
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,760
to set up AI tools for them. And you can

1237
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,280
kind of think of it like a a website

1238
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,960
design company, but instead of building

1239
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,880
websites for companies, you are helping

1240
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,280
businesses to use AI to save time or to

1241
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
make more money. And the best part about

1242
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,920
this is that while a development

1243
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,839
background is a nice to have, you don't

1244
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,440
have to know how to code to get started.

1245
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,960
And this is what myself and my team at

1246
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,440
Morningside figured out in 2023, about

1247
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,960
midway through the year, that we could

1248
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,119
sell AI solutions using no code and low

1249
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,720
code tools. And our clients didn't care

1250
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,240
that it wasn't customcoded. And since

1251
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,680
then, we've really mapped out dozens of

1252
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,440
low code and no code AI tools that allow

1253
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,599
you to basically drag and drop to create

1254
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,520
AI solutions for your clients. This

1255
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,200
means that there's no technical skills

1256
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,960
needed to get started. For example, one

1257
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,800
of my students, Isaiah, still doesn't

1258
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,240
know how to code, and he scaled his own

1259
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,800
AI automation agency to $25,000 per

1260
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,640
month, selling AI appointment setters to

1261
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,320
coaches and consultants. So, I've

1262
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,599
actually got an interview with him on

1263
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,720
this channel here. So, I'll put that in

1264
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,599
the description if you want to check

1265
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,520
that out. Personally, I started my AI

1266
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
automation agency, Morningside AI, in

1267
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,920
March of 2023. And with my business

1268
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,000
partner, we scaled it to over $100,000

1269
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,839
per month. And we got there by landing

1270
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,160
huge projects. I'm talking our biggest

1271
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,119
Morningside project being over

1272
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,040
$15,000 for the initial phase. And so

1273
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,240
I've done a full breakdown of this

1274
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,520
project on my channel. So again, I'll

1275
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
put it in the description if you want to

1276
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,800
check that after. But while reaching

1277
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,760
this $100,000 per month uh point wasn't

1278
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,920
easy, we had a lot of late nights and

1279
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,760
painful mistakes which I try to help you

1280
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,880
guys through on this channel. Our

1281
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,079
success proved that with the right

1282
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,839
marketing and the right team, there's a

1283
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,520
ton of money to be made with the AAA

1284
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,280
model. So for the pros of the AAA model,

1285
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,960
we have low startup costs because you

1286
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,720
don't need to have a fancy product built

1287
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,000
first. You can just start with a few

1288
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,440
subscriptions to low code and no code

1289
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,599
tools. Secondly, there's huge demand.

1290
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,599
Businesses are desperate for AI systems

1291
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,280
and tools that can help them adapt and

1292
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,720
be more efficient and make more money.

1293
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,560
And the AAA model is very scalable,

1294
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,160
meaning that you can start small and

1295
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,839
grow fast once you pick up traction. Now

1296
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,119
for the cons, I would say that the

1297
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,720
learning curve of the AI automation

1298
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,800
agency model is steeper than the AI

1299
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,560
influencer or AI consultant route.

1300
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,680
Meaning that it is going to take you

1301
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,280
relatively more time to get the hang of

1302
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
it. But once you do, you're in a great

1303
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,800
position to make serious money and scale

1304
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,079
it much more than you'll be able to do

1305
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,160
with say just AI influencing or an AI

1306
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,599
consulting business. So once you've got

1307
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,280
some experience, you can actually make

1308
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,200
money by teaching other people about AI.

1309
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,640
And there's huge demand for this right

1310
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,319
now. And this is what we'll call the AI

1311
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,160
education business model. It means

1312
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,560
creating online courses or ebooks or

1313
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,319
webinar which are like online classes

1314
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,000
for people. For example, you could teach

1315
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,839
realtors, real estate agents how to use

1316
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,160
AI to find more clients. Or you could

1317
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,560
even show show parents how to help their

1318
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
kids use AI for school so they can get

1319
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,000
good grades. You know, there's so much

1320
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,440
out there you can do right now. But the

1321
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,800
catch is you've actually got to know

1322
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,000
what you're talking about and have

1323
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,520
discovered something interesting that

1324
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,720
you can make an education product

1325
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,760
around. It's not something you can

1326
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,200
easily fake and you definitely can't

1327
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,960
fake it over the long term. So, the best

1328
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,160
way to actually learn something that you

1329
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,520
can make an educational product around

1330
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,599
is by running an AI automation agency

1331
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,839
because by working on real projects with

1332
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,920
clients, it gives you some real hands-on

1333
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,359
knowledge that you can then package into

1334
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,040
a course or a product. So, the pros for

1335
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,880
the AI education business model are that

1336
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,720
it can scale like crazy, meaning that

1337
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,240
you can sell your courses and your books

1338
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,160
to lots of people without having to do

1339
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,079
more work each time you sell a new copy.

1340
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,760
And so, you get high profit margins in

1341
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,599
these businesses because once a course

1342
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,599
is made, it doesn't cost much to sell it

1343
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,119
to more customers. And from my

1344
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,240
experience of running an education

1345
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,680
business, it feels really good to help

1346
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,200
people. And I've built some awesome

1347
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,240
relationships through the people that

1348
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,760
have helped in my education business. I

1349
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,119
even went to the wedding of one of my

1350
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,800
students last month in Italy. I'll put a

1351
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,160
photo up here of me and Isaiah. Now, for

1352
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,760
the cons, of course, it actually takes

1353
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,359
time to become an expert. You've got to

1354
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,960
go out and learn something new and

1355
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,319
actually get results before you can

1356
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
start to teach it. You can try to do it

1357
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,480
without doing that, but realistically,

1358
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,599
you're not going to last that long in

1359
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,520
the AI education space. And finally, the

1360
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,920
big one, AI SAS, which stands for

1361
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,000
software as a service. This is where you

1362
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
create a software tool which solves a

1363
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,280
specific problem typically for

1364
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,040
businesses using AI. And instead of

1365
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,319
doing the work for yourself for a

1366
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,760
business, you basically build a platform

1367
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,680
that businesses pay to use. So you can

1368
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,920
think of it like Netflix, but instead of

1369
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,760
movies, you're selling access to an AI

1370
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,359
tool that you've built that businesses

1371
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,880
want to use to make more money or save

1372
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,440
time, etc. So, in October of 2023, I saw

1373
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,280
an opportunity to build an AI SAS that

1374
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,119
would help AI automation agency owners

1375
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,800
like myself and like many people in my

1376
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,599
community to put the Open AI GPTs onto

1377
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,760
platforms like WhatsApp, onto websites,

1378
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,599
Instagram, and more. The videos that I

1379
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,359
did on these topics got hundreds of

1380
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,560
thousands of views so that I knew that

1381
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,319
there was a lot of interest in a

1382
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,640
solution like this. And so, now a year

1383
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,680
later, I've put over $300,000 into this

1384
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,079
business. We've got over 25,000 users on

1385
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,680
it and we're just starting to make money

1386
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,720
from it because we're rolling out

1387
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,280
monetization as we speak. But it took a

1388
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,720
lot of time and a lot of cash to get

1389
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,880
here is my point. So the pros of the AI

1390
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,640
SAS model are that firstly you get in

1391
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,240
most cases recurring revenue, meaning

1392
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,839
you get paid every month from each

1393
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,920
customer. Secondly, it's very scalable

1394
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,839
if you do it right. Once the software is

1395
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,599
actually built, you can sell it to lots

1396
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,359
of people with very little cost of of

1397
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,640
replication, which is similar to the

1398
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,240
education product we mentioned. And of

1399
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,920
course, if you do it right, you can sell

1400
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,839
the whole business for a big payout,

1401
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,280
which is called exiting your company.

1402
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,040
And for the cons, as I mentioned, it is

1403
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,560
very expensive to set one of these thing

1404
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,480
up relative to the other business models

1405
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
I've mentioned. You're probably going to

1406
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,839
need to spend a lot of money before you

1407
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,200
even start to see a profit from it

1408
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,319
because you have to build the whole

1409
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,760
software first and then eventually

1410
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,119
people come to it and you have to modify

1411
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,319
it to their needs, basically. And you

1412
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,520
have to keep improving it until you get

1413
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,880
to a point where people are happy to pay

1414
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
you money for it. And also because AI

1415
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,040
and the AI market is changing so fast,

1416
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,640
your software could become outdated

1417
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,000
overnight. So you put in all this effort

1418
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,839
into building this entire software and

1419
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,160
then overnight OpenAI releases something

1420
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,560
or anthropic etc. and your whole SAS is

1421
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,720
just done and useless. So big risk of

1422
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,839
that because you're investing a lot of

1423
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,599
time and energy into doing one thing. So

1424
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,960
after having those five business models

1425
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,240
thrown in your face, I bet you're

1426
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,319
wondering where should I start? So let

1427
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,640
me make this very simple. The AI

1428
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,800
automation agency model is by far the

1429
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
best choice if you want real momentum

1430
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,119
and to have lots of options later on in

1431
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,880
your AI journey. And so here's why.

1432
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,800
Firstly, AI automation agency owners

1433
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,040
learn the most valuable skills in the AI

1434
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,800
space. So, with influencing and

1435
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,720
consulting, they can be good to get you

1436
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,319
started, but they don't actually teach

1437
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,000
you the skills that matter the most. And

1438
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,520
so, with the AAA, you end up learning

1439
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,359
how to set up AI tools for businesses.

1440
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,119
You can automate their tasks. You can

1441
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,040
build systems that actually save time

1442
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,880
and money. And these skills are what

1443
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,560
businesses are willing to pay top dollar

1444
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,400
for. My success at Morningside and the

1445
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,760
other guys in the community are a

1446
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,520
testament to that. And these businesses

1447
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,200
will keep coming back for more as the

1448
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,560
technology continues to improve. and

1449
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,480
they need to keep up. The AI automation

1450
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,319
skill set that you pick up from being a

1451
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,560
AAA owner is what will make your future

1452
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,240
basically bulletproof. Regardless of

1453
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,599
what happens to your business, what

1454
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:16,960
happens to the economy, there's going to

1455
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,480
be demand for these AI automation

1456
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,240
experts who know how to implement AI

1457
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,000
into businesses to create value for

1458
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,440
them. Secondly, you're going to make

1459
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,280
more money. So, while consulting might

1460
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,200
earn you just a few thousand a month,

1461
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,720
and influencing can bring in some ad

1462
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,640
revenue and some sponsorships, they're

1463
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,040
both still very limited. And with an AI

1464
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,560
automation agency, you're going to be

1465
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,480
landing bigger contracts, thousands or

1466
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,000
tens of thousands or like I have

1467
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,520
hundreds of thousands of dollars per

1468
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,800
project. And that's exactly how my

1469
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,640
agency, Morningside AI, hit over

1470
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,960
$100,000 per month for the first time by

1471
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,640
stacking projects and building long-term

1472
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,920
relationships with our clients. So

1473
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,359
basically, the earning potential of the

1474
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,599
AAA model is way higher than the others

1475
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,440
while also still being accessible to

1476
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,200
beginners to start. And thirdly, the AAA

1477
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,480
model is the gateway to bigger

1478
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,720
opportunities in the AI space. So if you

1479
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,400
want to create a course or even build a

1480
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,160
software, then running a AAA

1481
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,599
successfully gives you the real world

1482
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,280
experience and results which you can

1483
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,880
then turn into courses that people will

1484
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,960
pay for. It's also incredibly useful for

1485
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,880
helping you spot software opportunities

1486
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,359
like I did when I built my AI SAS. So

1487
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,359
the AAA model is the only path that

1488
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,960
naturally opens these doors for you to

1489
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,119
AI education and to AI SAS as well. And

1490
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,520
finally, we are still so early to this.

1491
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,359
The truth is that most businesses still

1492
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,200
don't get what AI can do for them. They

1493
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,720
think it's just some tech buzzword that

1494
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,160
they might have to pay attention to in a

1495
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,680
couple of years. But that's where you

1496
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,280
come in. Right now, there's a huge

1497
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,680
chance to become the go-to expert in AI

1498
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,760
automation in your niche before everyone

1499
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,160
catches on. It's basically like being

1500
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,839
one of the first digital marketers back

1501
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,800
when uh websites were still new. The

1502
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,079
people who got in then, they made a

1503
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,920
fortune and the people who came later to

1504
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
things like SMA, they got the crumbs

1505
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,760
left under the table. So, if you want to

1506
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,839
start strong and learn the most valuable

1507
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,079
skills in the AI space and have the most

1508
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,480
options for the future, the AAA model is

1509
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,720
by far the best way to go. And from my

1510
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,839
experience and what I see in my

1511
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,400
communities as

1512
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,280
well. Okay. So, in this video, I'm going

1513
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,119
to be breaking down the simplest AI

1514
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,720
offer that you can make to businesses in

1515
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,640
order to get in the game, get a foot in

1516
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,079
the door, start getting a bit of

1517
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,680
experience, getting on client calls,

1518
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,599
start actually delivering something and

1519
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,119
getting into the game of selling things

1520
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,960
to businesses. Um, that doesn't require

1521
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,599
you to have a huge development team or

1522
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,319
extensive development experience or even

1523
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,760
experience getting on calls or or

1524
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,040
knowing how to generate leads. This

1525
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,800
really is the smallest little baby step

1526
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,880
offer that you can make in order to just

1527
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,720
start making some progress towards your

1528
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
end goal of being a successful AI

1529
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,240
automation agency owner or AI

1530
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,760
entrepreneur. So, this video is really

1531
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,040
intended for beginners who are trying to

1532
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,960
get into the game, but I just feel like

1533
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,240
they have no clue what they should

1534
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,599
offer. They don't really know how to do

1535
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,119
market research. They're having trouble

1536
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,240
generating leads or knowing what they

1537
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,319
should niche down to. So, if you are one

1538
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,680
of these people completely new to the

1539
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,520
game, this is going to solve a lot of

1540
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,200
your problems and answer some key

1541
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,119
questions for you. So first thing you

1542
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,640
need to understand about this let's put

1543
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,400
it up here simple

1544
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,599
sim list best list AI

1545
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:11,359
offer. So you need first thing you need

1546
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,800
to understand is the concept of a

1547
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,359
knowledge gap which is how we make money

1548
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,680
in the AI space generally or in any

1549
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,680
industry whatsoever really if it's a

1550
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,520
service based industry particularly. So

1551
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,119
if you take say S MMA and digital

1552
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,839
marketing SMAS social media marketing

1553
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,160
agencies make money because the owners

1554
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,880
and the team at the SMMA has a knowledge

1555
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,640
gap that between themselves and the

1556
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,160
businesses basically they know more

1557
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,000
about digital marketing and how to get

1558
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,680
results with it than the business owners

1559
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,920
do. So the business owners pay them to

1560
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,680
get that they pay them the difference of

1561
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,599
that knowledge gap basically. So let's

1562
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,960
start off with key concept of knowledge

1563
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,880
gap.

1564
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,160
This is going to make sense sense for a

1565
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,280
second and I will be giving you this

1566
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,640
shortly. I'm not going to drag it out

1567
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:59,000
forever. Um, knowledge gap. So basically

1568
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,720
um, so here's the continuum of all

1569
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,280
knowledge. Um, so here's using May

1570
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,880
example. Here's the business owner. All

1571
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,119
right, let's start this. This is zero.

1572
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,400
So this is zero. This is maybe 10. This

1573
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,280
is maybe a a 65 and this is a 100. So on

1574
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,720
this knowledge scale say these people

1575
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,480
are just the this is the best person in

1576
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,760
the world. This is the best agency or

1577
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,160
the best team the absolute best

1578
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,400
knowledge and you could say SMA or in

1579
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,880
this case it's going to be AI as to the

1580
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,599
expertise available. So they are really

1581
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,760
really worth a lot and they they are

1582
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,599
just own the market running everything

1583
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,880
because they know so much but they're

1584
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,400
obviously going to be very expensive

1585
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,920
because they have so much context and

1586
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,800
understanding. Now if the business owner

1587
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,640
is

1588
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,359
here say how do I draw a

1589
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:49,079
uh draw a

1590
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,680
business what's the fire going out so

1591
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,480
this is a

1592
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,880
business and this is say an

1593
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,599
agency aa

1594
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,520
agency this 65 represents the knowledge

1595
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,839
that maybe the average one has or or a a

1596
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,680
one that's sort of doing well initially

1597
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,200
but it's yet to sort of scale into later

1598
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,760
ends of of running an agency

1599
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,880
successfully. But basically, businesses

1600
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,960
will come to this agency and they'll be

1601
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,559
like, "Hey, I need help with this AI

1602
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,160
thing. I don't know anything really

1603
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,400
about the technology. I don't know uh

1604
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,920
what what use cases are best for my

1605
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,280
business and I'm really just stuck and

1606
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,040
and I want some help and I'm also going

1607
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,240
to need your expertise to help me

1608
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,160
implement this without dozens and dozens

1609
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,599
of issues by trying to do it myself."

1610
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,359
So this is how this gap

1611
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:37,040
here is where this agency is going to

1612
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,800
make their money because they have a

1613
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,640
knowledge gap between where what the

1614
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,400
business knows about AI and what they

1615
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,760
know about AI and also their

1616
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,200
capabilities when it comes to the DF

1617
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,640
team and stuff. Now most of you starting

1618
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,480
off when you are getting into AI say

1619
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,760
let's just say the average business

1620
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,559
owner average is about a 10 on this.

1621
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,559
Most people are trying to jump all the

1622
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,640
way to this point here and be a a

1623
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,880
fullyfledged agency and and just sell

1624
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,280
every the whole nine yards when in

1625
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,599
reality um or or they think they need to

1626
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:06,960
be there immediately until they don't

1627
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,160
get started with the business or they

1628
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,880
think, "Oh, it's not for me." In

1629
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,040
reality, you can

1630
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,200
be at maybe 25 here and have

1631
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,800
you with your little agency or just just

1632
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,960
yourself, but you know more than that

1633
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,240
business and you can still make money in

1634
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,640
this gap. The question is how and what

1635
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,920
is the offer and that's what I'm going

1636
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,119
to reveal to you in a second. So, this

1637
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,599
is very key concept to anything. This is

1638
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,280
why you should always be trying to

1639
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,040
expand either your knowledge and this

1640
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,280
gap does represent your team as well. So

1641
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,200
I I talk a lot about it in my uh in my

1642
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,960
program, but this knowledge gap can be

1643
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,400
expanded through your team. It's it's

1644
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,839
kind of the combined of either your

1645
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,760
brain and then also all of the team that

1646
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,040
you have with it. So when you make a new

1647
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,839
hire, suddenly you can jump from 25 to

1648
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,440
35 because you brought on a really good

1649
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,920
AI developer who significantly moves or

1650
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,440
increases the knowledge gap. And this

1651
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,200
can also account factor in things like

1652
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
experience and things you've done before

1653
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,119
that allows you to be more valuable to

1654
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,800
them because you've done done the same

1655
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,079
thing before and you're going to get

1656
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,119
less issues when you do it.

1657
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:08,319
So step one, understanding that

1658
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,119
knowledge gap. I do have a pretty

1659
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,839
miserable uh eraser here. Sorry. So if

1660
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,280
you give me a second and so you

1661
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,800
understand what knowledge gap is. Tick

1662
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,319
tick. Now the question is when you have

1663
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,760
such a small knowledge gap or even

1664
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,520
non-existent, maybe you just found my

1665
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,200
video or found the space as a whole.

1666
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,319
You're like, "Wow, I want to get into

1667
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,480
this, but I'm at I I'm like either

1668
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,000
behind where the average business owner

1669
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,680
is or I'm about where this where they

1670
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,359
are at the moment. I kind of have a a

1671
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,160
basic knowledge of it as well. So, what

1672
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,839
you need to be looking at is how you can

1673
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,599
increase that knowledge gap and then

1674
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:40,960
make an offer that allows you to sell

1675
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,200
back down that and profit from that gap.

1676
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,319
All right. So, I'm going to introduce

1677
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:49,000
you to this concept of um AI

1678
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,510
tools

1679
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,920
[Music]

1680
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,640
consulting. Now, what is this? This is

1681
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,000
basically the most basic and simple

1682
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,520
thing that I could possibly come up with

1683
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,760
for getting into the space where you are

1684
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,280
essentially a consultant that helps

1685
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,079
business owners to identify the best AI

1686
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,920
tools to use in your existing processes

1687
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,480
and and for their for their team

1688
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,599
currently. Now, the reason this is so

1689
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,200
great is because it skips the entire

1690
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,880
step of having to do implementation and

1691
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,400
own a development team because it's kind

1692
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,040
of like you're just uh you're

1693
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,960
selling

1694
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,960
other people's

1695
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:28,880
stuff which as a general rule of thumb

1696
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,319
when you're starting businesses or

1697
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,079
getting started with running a business

1698
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,839
or you want to make money online the

1699
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,599
easiest way to do it and this is

1700
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,040
something I I wish I could sort of

1701
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,880
learned early in my journey is that it's

1702
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,440
easy to sell other people's stuff um

1703
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,800
where they've already got a clearly

1704
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,640
defined marketing process or they've got

1705
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,480
a really great product that they spend a

1706
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,160
lot of money on or the service is really

1707
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,359
good and there's a killer offer that

1708
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,200
comes with it. It's easy to sell other

1709
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,240
people's stuff where they haven't done

1710
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,680
all the hard work on the product or the

1711
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,200
service than to try and do it all

1712
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,800
yourself. So when I first started my

1713
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,400
very first online business through

1714
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,240
e-commerce and drop shipping, sure I was

1715
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,480
selling someone else's product, but I

1716
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,079
was still doing the entire business

1717
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,520
thing myself. And when you come from

1718
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,680
absolutely zero on the entrepreneur

1719
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,760
scale, trying to jump from there to

1720
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,200
running a whole business and having

1721
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,559
having a team that you got to manage,

1722
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,119
managing suppliers, uh managing finances

1723
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,640
and stuff like this, it's a lot to lot

1724
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,040
to pick up early on. Um, but if you

1725
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,280
aren't say fitting in as a salesperson,

1726
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,800
you're selling someone else's product in

1727
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,240
the framework of their business and

1728
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,520
they've already got everything dialed

1729
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,960
in. They've done all the hard work and

1730
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,160
you get to come along and sell their

1731
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,839
products and make money. So, that is

1732
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,520
something that that as sort of a side

1733
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,160
note um is a is a good practice. And in

1734
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,520
this case, we're kind of stealing from

1735
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,280
from that idea. We're basically selling

1736
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,280
other people's tools or selling other

1737
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,960
people's products without having to

1738
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,119
first build them ourselves. So, I've

1739
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,319
talked recently in my video about the

1740
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,400
new kind of AI agency model that's going

1741
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,240
to going to really surge this year. Um,

1742
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,799
and me, myself, and the team at

1743
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:52,799
Morningside and Peep Lurch. Um, I've

1744
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:53,760
been wearing this a lot. I don't know

1745
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,040
why I wasn't wearing this in videos

1746
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,720
more, but um, yeah, we've all been

1747
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,319
wearing it into the office, so I'll just

1748
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,079
come back and, uh, here we are. So, um,

1749
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,520
I'll do a bit more of a spectrum thing

1750
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,880
again that will also help break this

1751
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,720
down for you. So on the furthest end of

1752
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,399
the spectrum here in terms of like

1753
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:16,079
difficulty we have

1754
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:23,640
implementation by this I mean AI dev

1755
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,799
services svc services uh

1756
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,440
implementmentation implementation and

1757
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,880
then we have on this side I I don't know

1758
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,720
which one you put in front of the other

1759
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,640
I probably would go actually yeah

1760
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,279
education first

1761
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,559
cuz I mean any of you can watch a whole

1762
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,000
bunch of YouTube videos kind of compile

1763
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,920
it together use AI to help you write a

1764
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,160
nice script or make it into some some

1765
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,200
presentation um and then the sort of

1766
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,799
middle point here I'd probably actually

1767
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,520
put it sort of more to that side is uh

1768
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,000
consulting which is what you're doing

1769
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,599
here and this is kind of how I started

1770
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,280
off I I guess in both these when I

1771
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,559
started my journey I was making YouTube

1772
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,240
videos and then I was selling consulting

1773
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,280
through my YouTube channel and saying,

1774
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,400
"Hey, if you want to learn more about

1775
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,160
this AI chatbot I just built. You can

1776
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,440
book a call with me down below." And

1777
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,040
that was my original way of monetizing

1778
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,359
my my skills in the AI space and allowed

1779
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,119
me to build a lot of confidence on my uh

1780
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,359
on my uh the consulting course that I

1781
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,359
did. Um and that allowed me to

1782
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,640
eventually get down to the

1783
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,799
implementations that providing my own AI

1784
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,040
automation agency, Morningside AI. Now,

1785
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,640
the reason I'm telling you this is

1786
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,920
because um you don't need to unless you

1787
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,520
really really have either the resources

1788
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,440
or you want to go all out and and really

1789
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,480
learn these tools. Um by tools I mean

1790
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,000
the the service delivery platforms like

1791
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,040
Forest Flow, Agentive, Make um relevant

1792
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,280
AI, all these Vappy all these kind of

1793
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,000
service delivery platforms for AI

1794
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,760
agencies. This is is obviously the

1795
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,200
skills here are much better and much

1796
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,040
more valuable. But if you're just all

1797
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,720
going to get started, then these are

1798
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,119
also options for you. But if you're a

1799
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,720
developer, I'd highly recommend that you

1800
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,480
do swing that way first because it uses

1801
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,680
your skills. But some people are just

1802
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,359
starting with absolutely nothing. So

1803
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,040
this is a good place to start to just

1804
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,119
get familiar with the process of AI

1805
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,640
freelancing and and running your own

1806
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,720
business. So education, we're not really

1807
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,760
going to focus on that in this video,

1808
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,680
but what this offer is is essentially a

1809
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,599
consulting offer where, and I'm going to

1810
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,079
give you the process in a second, you

1811
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,319
are doing these AI tool consults for

1812
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,760
free. initially I'd recommend for

1813
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,440
businesses and you could you can just

1814
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,720
continue doing them for free as a lead

1815
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,319
magnet as we're going to go going to go

1816
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,760
into in a second but this is so that you

1817
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,480
don't have to jump immediately to this

1818
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,920
where either you are deving this stuff

1819
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,680
yourself and in that case need to spend

1820
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,920
maybe uh not not maybe you definitely

1821
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,680
need to spend a few months of of

1822
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,760
learning and spending and spending time

1823
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,520
consistently practicing and and

1824
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,960
following tutorials and consuming

1825
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,480
content on YouTube about the the best

1826
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,920
use cases and how to build them and then

1827
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,119
getting to a stage where you're actually

1828
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,200
able to pitch businesses and you do all

1829
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,480
the lead generation stuff as well. So,

1830
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,839
there's quite a lot to that and this is

1831
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:57,119
definitely a great starting point for

1832
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,720
people with either business backgrounds

1833
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,559
and they can hire for developers

1834
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,799
immediately or for developers who can

1835
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,160
start doing it themselves. But some of

1836
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,000
you with no business experience and even

1837
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,920
no technical experience as well, this is

1838
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,000
a better place to start. Um, so let me

1839
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,720
just rub this off. Um, actually I can

1840
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,240
just jump straight into it. So basically

1841
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,280
the AI tools consulting process is it's

1842
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,280
pretty straightforward. Um what I would

1843
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,359
recommend you do is firstly create that

1844
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,799
knowledge gap right so even if you

1845
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,400
starting at zero on that scale I drew

1846
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,720
before you can

1847
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:39,440
um you can number one find

1848
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,240
tools and I'll explain how you monetize

1849
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,920
this in a second so just just stick with

1850
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,880
me um it's actually pretty pretty nifty

1851
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,400
and also how you get clients. I'm going

1852
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,079
to touch on that briefly here as well.

1853
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,559
Um, doesn't need to be something crazy.

1854
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,480
Uh, but fine tools. This means you're

1855
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,760
going to be going on things like

1856
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,200
YouTube. Now, thankfully, there's people

1857
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,160
like myself and others. I mean, I think

1858
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,760
by the time this video goes out, I will

1859
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,760
have just posted one about AI tools that

1860
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,079
I use in my business. So, uh, to make

1861
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,440
quite a lot of money as well. So, I'll

1862
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,839
put these things up here. Um, it'll be

1863
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,760
up there and maybe in the description as

1864
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,040
well. my recent AI tools video that I

1865
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,400
did. Um, but you can watch a bunch of

1866
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,000
YouTube videos to find the best tools. I

1867
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,440
mean, there's always these videos about

1868
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,760
I tried a bajillion AI tools and these

1869
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,680
are the best ones. So, I mean, if these

1870
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,599
guys are

1871
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:28,799
really, they're not lying. They've done

1872
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,880
a lot of hard work for you. Um, and you

1873
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,240
can find some great tools watching these

1874
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,920
videos. Now, my process that I'd

1875
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,440
recommend is that you watch you find

1876
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,359
these tools by YouTube videos. It's

1877
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:38,559
probably going to be the best way to do

1878
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:44,480
it. Um, and then you go um and make a

1879
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,480
list. I'd go put these on a a Google

1880
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,440
sheet or something and just put a whole

1881
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,359
bunch of links and names and everything

1882
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:54,319
and and do a little bit of

1883
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,079
categorization even. You can say, "Hey,

1884
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,000
this is a creative thing or an AI image

1885
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,119
generator or video generator, etc." And

1886
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,520
then

1887
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:07,400
thirdly, I would deep dive.

1888
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,559
So that means on each of these, actually

1889
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:11,839
I wouldn't do each of them. I would make

1890
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,359
sure that this list you kind of narrow

1891
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,520
it down to a short list of the best ones

1892
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,799
based off what these guys in these

1893
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,720
videos are talking about. Um you maybe

1894
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,920
pick a bunch in a couple different

1895
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,839
categories like okay these seemingly the

1896
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,599
best image generators, the best video

1897
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,240
generators, etc. the best writing tools.

1898
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,000
And then you start to you make a short

1899
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,280
list that you're going to do a deep dive

1900
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,520
on. Now deep diving means I would then

1901
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,720
go and go uh YouTube search again

1902
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,640
and but specifically for that to talk.

1903
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,839
So I would be saying okay let's find say

1904
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,599
it was runway and you search up runway

1905
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,520
AI tutorial and you start to go through

1906
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,799
it and watch you see what people are

1907
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,040
doing with it and you see best runway AI

1908
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,559
use cases or best video generation um

1909
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,520
best AI video generation use cases and

1910
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,440
you find them either on uh YouTube is a

1911
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,799
great place to do it but some of these

1912
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,559
tools are so new and so obscure that you

1913
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,000
won't even find much you might need to

1914
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
go to a Google search even basically do

1915
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,680
a deep dive and see if anyone has has

1916
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,200
revealed some cool stuff you can do with

1917
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,240
this just to build up the context

1918
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,160
objects that you have on it. And then I

1919
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,399
would also go and try it

1920
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,240
yourself. And so once you've done that

1921
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,760
and you've you've had a bit of a play

1922
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,880
around with it, you've got familiar with

1923
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,480
it and you're like, "Okay, I know how

1924
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,000
this works. I know that I know that

1925
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,359
Runway has this feature that allows me

1926
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:26,960
to go from image to video. Okay, great.

1927
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,480
That's now I've sort of pinned that and

1928
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,240
you're building your knowledge gap just

1929
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,760
by watching videos and having a play

1930
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,000
around. It's pretty cool." Um, and

1931
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,720
ultimately number four, I would make

1932
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,919
like a tools

1933
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:43,359
db where uh I'd like you to do this on

1934
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,359
notion if you not haven't used notion

1935
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:50,079
before n o t i o n notion and you can

1936
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,079
create a bit of a tools database. Um,

1937
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,520
use whatever you feel like really. You

1938
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,200
could use Google Docs or you could use

1939
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,640
pages or or who use pages? Word or or

1940
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,720
whatever your favorite bloody document

1941
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,480
processing thing is, but some kind of

1942
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,599
database where you've gone on these

1943
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,480
Gives and then you've got runway bam bam

1944
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,040
bam category this this this best uses

1945
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,880
for this this features this this this

1946
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,319
and you start to create your own

1947
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,440
internal database of tools and I would

1948
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,799
highly recommend you use some kind of

1949
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,960
like a database feature with a notion.

1950
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,480
So you can create your own columns and

1951
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,160
you can add in you can do this in sheets

1952
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,599
as well but notion is a lot easier for

1953
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,839
filtering etc. Um, and then you can set

1954
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,359
up filters like, okay, this is a

1955
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,520
creative tool. Okay, this is uh could be

1956
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,920
useful for this specific use case. And

1957
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,359
you start to build up this internal

1958
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,240
knowledge base or database of the best

1959
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,760
tools. And you've ranked them in in

1960
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,680
certain ways so that when it comes to

1961
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,440
delivering that service of this AI tools

1962
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,200
consulting, you can go, okay, well,

1963
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,720
we're looking for some creative tools.

1964
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,920
You're on a call with them, as I'm going

1965
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,119
to break down the process in a second,

1966
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,880
but you're on a call with them and they

1967
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,559
say, I we've got a we've got a team who

1968
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,799
does uh SEO writing for us. Okay, great.

1969
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,319
Well, um you just go on to your little

1970
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,079
thing, not probably not on the call, but

1971
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,640
um uh afterwards or in the in the report

1972
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,000
making phase, which I'll touch on in a

1973
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,920
second, and you can quickly pull these

1974
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,359
up and you've got all this context on it

1975
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,319
and you can read through it and you go,

1976
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:05,680
"Oh, okay. Yeah, I remember that tool

1977
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,440
now. Great, great, great. Okay, now I

1978
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,640
can put that into the recommendations

1979
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,640
list for them." So, that's the process

1980
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,720
to start. And by this point, if you've

1981
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,640
got a a tools DB fil thought out with 50

1982
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,559
tools and you've done a write up on each

1983
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:17,920
of them and you've had a play around

1984
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,440
with them as well, you've got a

1985
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,319
significant way down that say most of

1986
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,160
business are here. You're now definitely

1987
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,720
moving over this way and you start to

1988
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,720
know what these tools are good for. And

1989
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,240
again, you haven't had to go and build

1990
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,520
all this stuff yourself. You're purely

1991
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,520
just recommending things at the at this

1992
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,240
time. So to break break down what this

1993
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,400
would actually look like in in reality,

1994
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,839
I'm probably going to run a whiteboard

1995
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,720
space here, but

1996
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,000
um the way you'd pitch this is that you

1997
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,839
have some kind of three-step process or

1998
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,240
something. So I'd say it's a free and

1999
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,920
I'll get into how you market it in a

2000
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,319
second, but free um AI

2001
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,839
tools. I'd probably play around with the

2002
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,440
naming a bit more um to make it sound a

2003
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,760
bit more sexy. Um, but I'm sure you can

2004
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,640
figure that out with the help of PL with

2005
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,559
OGBT. But with principle, you say one,

2006
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,079
we hop on a free

2007
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:12,640
consult where you ask them a whole bunch

2008
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,480
of questions and you learn about the

2009
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,440
business and the different departments

2010
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,119
and you sort of note it all down. You

2011
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,880
say, "Okay, great. Well, after this

2012
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,480
call, just to make it extra easy for

2013
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,640
you, I know this is how I would have

2014
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,160
approached it when how I did approach it

2015
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,160
when I was doing my consulting calls is

2016
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,000
don't try to put yourself on under the

2017
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,160
pump to deliver on that call. You are

2018
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,359
not if you're just starting out, you're

2019
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:32,720
not good enough. You don't know enough

2020
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,240
and you can't be expected to know enough

2021
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,400
to just be able to be shooting off tools

2022
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,799
like like immediately knowing what they

2023
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,000
should fit into within the different

2024
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,520
business departments. Maybe if you've

2025
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,039
done enough here, you could do confident

2026
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,119
to, but just to get started for most of

2027
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:48,079
you, I would say do the free console and

2028
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,240
then say, okay, step two of our process

2029
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,760
is we'll um

2030
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:55,480
match plus find

2031
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,839
more. So you can say we've got this this

2032
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,520
internal database that we use that's got

2033
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,440
all the best tools um and we match them

2034
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,920
up uh internally, but we'll also go out

2035
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,720
and do a a further deep dive for your

2036
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,079
business and for your industry

2037
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,520
specifically. So this way you can handle

2038
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,200
a lot of different industries and you

2039
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,400
might be able to come up with some some

2040
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,680
really cool ones that are specific to

2041
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,160
that industry that you find. Um and here

2042
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,880
you can use things like um there's an AI

2043
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,119
for

2044
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:24,280
that

2045
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,640
or or you got future

2046
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,280
tools. So there's these there's an AI

2047
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,559
for that. There's a website where you

2048
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,880
can kind of just search up if there's an

2049
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,640
AI tool for the thing you need. uh

2050
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,960
future tools also is similar. I'll put

2051
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,480
both those links down below if you want

2052
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,480
to check those out. But this is step

2053
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,319
step two where you're matching them with

2054
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,319
your internal ones and also finding

2055
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,760
morph. And then step

2056
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,160
three is a

2057
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,240
report as a report. So you write up a

2058
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,160
report for them. You can use like some

2059
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,240
kind of Canva template or you could just

2060
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,160
use a nice letter head and a bit of

2061
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,799
branding on your uh Google Docs or you

2062
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,559
could just just do it blank document. I

2063
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,160
mean initially just to keep things

2064
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,680
simple. Don't let that stuff hold you

2065
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,599
back from just doing it. Um and you

2066
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,000
write up a report for them and you hop

2067
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,440
on another call or you just send that to

2068
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,720
them directly. I probably hop on another

2069
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,559
call to get to sort of run through that

2070
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,160
process and get give them the idea and

2071
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,440
walk them through how you want to do it.

2072
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,280
get a bit of feedback cuz all this is

2073
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,760
going to be helping you to move further

2074
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,160
down this and just a key part in getting

2075
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,720
to this point of implementing is getting

2076
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,400
comfortable on those sales calls and

2077
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,000
being like knowing how to deal with

2078
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,760
people and you start to realize oh

2079
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,280
there's all these different characters I

2080
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,200
can meet and I kind of know how to

2081
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,960
handle that one per that kind of person

2082
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,799
now and it's just building up those

2083
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,079
entrepreneurial and business skills

2084
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,039
slowly but surely and this this way you

2085
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,200
get two charts so the the free consult

2086
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,440
and then you break down the report for

2087
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,920
Now, I know what you're asking, Liam.

2088
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,839
How do I get clients and how do I make

2089
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,079
money from this? Okay. Well, first

2090
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,880
things first is that with vegan started,

2091
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,480
money is not really I know it might be

2092
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,000
like, oh, I need I need to pay my bills

2093
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,680
and stuff, but you should not be

2094
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,280
starting one of these businesses. If

2095
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,359
you're in a position where you are like,

2096
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,039
okay, I need to I need to pay my bills

2097
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,200
next week with this. That is it's not

2098
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,880
going to work. maybe one in a 100. Some

2099
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,399
of them will just finesse and like

2100
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,080
hustle their way to making money, but

2101
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,319
for the most part, you are going to need

2102
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,000
to give this a significant amount of

2103
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,920
time to get up and running. And that

2104
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,158
means taking on free clients and

2105
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:27,520
building up your skills slowly but

2106
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,759
surely and your

2107
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:30,560
confidence. You might be doing these

2108
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,960
free consults for for one or two months

2109
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,799
even if you depending on the volume of

2110
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,719
them you do until you're really really

2111
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,479
good at it and people are are really

2112
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,319
happy with this the end result. So this

2113
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,238
is really the key you think. are they

2114
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,479
happy afterwards? So getting feedback on

2115
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:46,319
that call or even getting feedback after

2116
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,640
by email is essential. Checking in with

2117
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,479
them maybe a week or two after they have

2118
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,158
implemented them or probably a week or

2119
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:53,839
two is about a good good amount of time.

2120
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:54,960
And if they're not saying, "Wow, yeah,

2121
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,158
this this has really been massively

2122
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:57,600
helpful," then you need to work work

2123
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,359
more on this um in your matching

2124
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,279
process. But going back to getting

2125
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,439
clients and making money, as I said,

2126
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,040
first off, making money is not the

2127
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,120
should not be the goal initially. If you

2128
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,560
want to really get to the end and be

2129
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,238
making a lot of money, you need to take

2130
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:12,080
that off your brain initially and just

2131
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,839
work through the process slowly of

2132
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,600
getting used to talking on calls and and

2133
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,439
building a knowledge gap. Um, and this

2134
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,880
is really that the flywheel for you to

2135
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,158
do that. But to give you the the longer

2136
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,359
term uh strategy, the process here is

2137
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,239
going to be the

2138
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:32,560
monetization is from eventually you can

2139
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,759
use your affiliates

2140
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,439
So, you can get 20 15% uh of the monthly

2141
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:42,880
recurring that these companies sign up

2142
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,560
to. If these are decent sized companies

2143
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,399
and they're going to be high quality or

2144
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,158
or long-term users of these apps, then

2145
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:49,679
if you do enough of these free audits,

2146
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:50,799
you're going to build up some passive

2147
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,319
income for yourself where you might

2148
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,080
making a few hundred and eventually a

2149
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,159
few thousand per month, right? So that's

2150
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,679
really determined by the quality of the

2151
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:58,960
people that you're putting through

2152
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,800
because if you're getting some and also

2153
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,159
the quality of your matching of the

2154
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,320
tools um and also the affiliate

2155
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,120
commission that they pay out but uh

2156
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,480
you'll see a lot of churn in terms of

2157
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,679
okay I recommended that but they never

2158
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:10,960
end they used it for 2 months and they

2159
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,800
fell off. If you really find a good tool

2160
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,000
for them then they will continue to use

2161
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,280
that. So that really comes down to you

2162
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,560
but also making sure that the business

2163
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,040
that you choose is uh is someone who's

2164
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,400
going to be a long-term user of it and

2165
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,679
not just kind of jump around either

2166
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,440
they're too small to really stick with

2167
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,560
it etc. But the second way, and it's

2168
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,000
probably more of a longer term one that

2169
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,600
you look to do, is through

2170
01:10:32,199 --> 01:10:34,320
partners. So, what you're doing here is

2171
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,679
essentially taking people from being

2172
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,679
unaware or or or not really implementing

2173
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,480
AI into their business or being familiar

2174
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,800
with it to the point where they're now

2175
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,080
experimenting with it and they're like,

2176
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,840
"Oh, well, this is kind of cool. I they

2177
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
start to see the value." And it's like

2178
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,840
when people first started putting

2179
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,280
websites up and they started getting the

2180
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,560
odd call from them. It's like, "Hey, I

2181
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,159
just found your website." or they get an

2182
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:55,600
email like, "Hey, I just found your

2183
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,199
website. Was wondering if you could do

2184
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,719
this." And it's it's they start to see

2185
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,440
it. Okay. Like now I get this now. I get

2186
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,120
this web thing. And in this case, I get

2187
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,719
this AI thing like these really helpful

2188
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,239
tools where they can search the whole

2189
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,600
web and pull things back or write

2190
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,800
reports for us.

2191
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,159
Um, but the thing about that is that

2192
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:14,400
you've just moved them down closer

2193
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,920
towards the point where they're ready to

2194
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,520
go to the implementation step. they're

2195
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,600
ready to maybe hop onto a a a more

2196
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,000
expensive consulting offer and an AI

2197
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,920
audit with someone who can really do the

2198
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,840
entire AI audit process and then

2199
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,440
stepping through to implementation. So

2200
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,320
partners here at Morningside, we have de

2201
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,840
partners because we get so many leads

2202
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,840
from this awesome channel and and you

2203
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,600
guys who support us so much because

2204
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,800
alongside you guys are going to start

2205
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,960
agencies and a lot of my bigger videos,

2206
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,040
we get like thousands and thousands

2207
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,640
thousands of business owners and often

2208
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,239
and we're seeing more and more like

2209
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,400
higher tier and high level um business

2210
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,080
owners and larger companies reaching out

2211
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,159
to us uh because of the size of the

2212
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,600
channel as as much as it's grown. So

2213
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,960
that's been awesome. And we have

2214
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,719
partnership deals. We have the ex excess

2215
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,400
leads that we can't really handle or we

2216
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,679
don't we don't necessarily want to do

2217
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,440
that kind of project if I'm honest. Um

2218
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,360
we have partners who we offer them to

2219
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,520
and if they close a deal um we get

2220
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,679
anywhere from 10 to 20% uh depending on

2221
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,520
the partner um and the side of the deal.

2222
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,760
So you can do the same thing. There are

2223
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,360
people who are coming in and they do

2224
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,640
have this side but they don't want to do

2225
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,239
this side. And you can find them either

2226
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,679
in my free community or in paid

2227
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:16,960
communities like my accelerator. Of

2228
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,960
course, I'm not like I don't want to

2229
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,640
like make this a sales pitch, but if

2230
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,760
you're looking to find high quality

2231
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,520
implementation partners, then you may

2232
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,360
need to spend a bit of money to find get

2233
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,360
in a group or get in an area or a place

2234
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,120
online where you can find those dear

2235
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,480
partners or even look locally. You can

2236
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,840
go on Google Maps and there might be

2237
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,920
some AI development shops popping up in

2238
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,840
your city um and you can get in touch

2239
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,199
with them and say, "Hey, I might have

2240
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,480
some leads for you. Could we set up a

2241
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,760
deal here?" So this can be sort of 10 to

2242
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,840
20%

2243
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,840
um of say maybe a five to 10k deal

2244
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,440
initially. Um so that's good money. And

2245
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,199
then affiliates, you'll start off a few

2246
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,920
hundred, maybe like $200 and then get up

2247
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,440
to maybe $1,000 per month.

2248
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,960
Um yeah, that's not going to happen

2249
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,320
overnight, but it's still money and

2250
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,239
you're still building up your building a

2251
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:05,600
bit of momentum with your AI business

2252
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,440
and in the AI space. Now, the final step

2253
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,120
is, of course, how do you get clients?

2254
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,400
How are you going to attract people to

2255
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,159
this offer of yours? And I'm glad you

2256
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:13,679
asked, cuz I've got a simple solution

2257
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,679
for you. And this is pretty much what I

2258
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:18,880
recommend to uh everyone. Um, so you

2259
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,360
need to turn people from these unknown

2260
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,560
people who don't know about your

2261
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,880
business at all or the offer that you

2262
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,880
have into people that are booking in

2263
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,960
these free

2264
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,679
audits, free tool

2265
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,360
audits. And the best ways to get people

2266
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,280
initially to get things off the ground,

2267
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,040
um, there's a few strategies. Firstly,

2268
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,280
warm

2269
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:45,360
outreach. Alex Mozi has a great one on

2270
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,640
warm outreach, which I'm not even going

2271
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,199
to try to try to outdo. Um, I'm going to

2272
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,960
put it in the description below for you.

2273
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,120
Basically, you have a lot of people that

2274
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,480
you have contact to, either your old

2275
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,840
email contacts, your Facebook friends,

2276
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,440
your Instagram followers, all the people

2277
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,120
in your phone contacts. And these are

2278
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,440
people who either may themselves want

2279
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,040
this kind of thing and say, "Hey, look,

2280
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,040
I've I've built this entire database of

2281
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,719
AI tools. I've been spending a lot of

2282
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,239
time working with them. Um, and I'm

2283
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:09,440
doing this thing where I'm now helping

2284
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,159
businesses for free um to do a a

2285
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,800
30-minute AI tools audit. Um, do you

2286
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,159
know anyone?" Well, this is the pitch in

2287
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:17,520
the warm outreach, and this is what's

2288
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,719
going to be included in that in that

2289
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,640
podcast from Alex Moz. It's done part of

2290
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,719
his 100 billion leads book, but it's the

2291
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,920
audio version again, 100% free. Um, but

2292
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,159
that you can ask them if you know anyone

2293
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:30,719
who would be interested in this kind of

2294
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,280
offer, right? And they either will know

2295
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,280
people themselves or know people that

2296
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,560
would be interested and they say, "Hey,

2297
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,159
yeah, great. I can put you in touch."

2298
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,080
Um, or they may be interested in it

2299
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,520
themselves, but by not asking them

2300
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,679
directly, it's not like, "Hey man, can

2301
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,040
you buy my stuff?" or like, "Can I do

2302
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,199
this for you?" The fact that it's free

2303
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,280
makes that actually a bit a bit a little

2304
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,640
less bad. Like, you probably could just

2305
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,199
ask them directly and say, "Hey, like,

2306
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,640
do you do you want me to do a free AI?

2307
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,840
What if we I know a whole bunch about

2308
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,040
these things. I just have a quick check

2309
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,600
over take 30 minutes. Um so that's str

2310
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,960
one. I'll leave a link to that down

2311
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,920
below. Um next strat would be cold

2312
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,560
email. This one takes a bit more to set

2313
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,000
up and honestly wouldn't recommend it

2314
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,600
for beginners, but um if you are

2315
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,280
familiar with cold email, um you could

2316
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,719
definitely blast out this kind of offer

2317
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,960
once you test the copy enough um to get

2318
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,400
them say, "Hey, like yes, sure, I'd be

2319
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,000
interested." Um depending on the

2320
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,600
targeting that you do, of course, cold

2321
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,040
email is a whole whole different box of

2322
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,040
frogs. Um, a cold email is one because

2323
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,560
you can reach out to like hundreds of

2324
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,239
people a day with the same offer and

2325
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,600
start booking in calls and moving them

2326
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,960
through that process. And then of course

2327
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,120
we have organic

2328
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,640
content. So you can try to on on

2329
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,800
LinkedIn make social posts and stuff. I

2330
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,320
wouldn't I'd probably go the YouTube

2331
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,159
side personally because then you can

2332
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:45,360
make videos like uh best AI tools for

2333
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,040
for builders or plumber. I keep using

2334
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,800
builders and plumbers example. I think

2335
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,440
it's such a an interesting idea about AI

2336
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,040
service providers for these industries.

2337
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,880
But making YouTube videos talking about

2338
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,960
industry by industry the best tools. Um

2339
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,520
you could even just use chatbt or or 01

2340
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,280
or whatever fancy model that you want to

2341
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,120
use these days to help you think through

2342
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,880
the problems that businesses would face.

2343
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,719
And then you without even really knowing

2344
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,080
it, sure you could jump on Reddit, you

2345
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,280
could jump on YouTube and do a bit of

2346
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,120
market research about the problems that

2347
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,040
a different niche would face. And then

2348
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,719
you can match up with your tools

2349
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,480
database. you can go okay well this tool

2350
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,760
this tool this tool this tool for these

2351
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,800
different parts of the business that I

2352
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,400
know they have issues with then you can

2353
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,320
make your video six AI tools relatives

2354
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,000
or etc and you just kind of go through

2355
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,159
the list and because those are tagged by

2356
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,840
the niche that you put in the in the

2357
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,600
search term it's quite in the title when

2358
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,960
people are searching for AI stuff

2359
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,239
realtors there's a chance you're going

2360
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,000
to pop up and then there's a chance it

2361
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,840
will also book in the free consult with

2362
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,080
you and in that video you can say like

2363
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,679
literally just before you get stuck into

2364
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,360
it or and then probably towards the end

2365
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,440
as well do two CTAs and that say hey if

2366
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,880
you're interested in a free AI tools

2367
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,560
consult for your business. Head down

2368
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,800
below and book in a call with me. Bam.

2369
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,280
And once you've got a good amount of uh

2370
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,480
traffic coming from this, you can

2371
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,159
actually turn this for free and you can

2372
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,600
start charging um $100 for it. You know,

2373
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,920
my my consulting calls started off at I

2374
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,600
think$150 or 200 bucks. Jack that up to

2375
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,679
$300 cuz I getting so many. Jack it up

2376
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,520
to $500 cuz I was still getting so many

2377
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,840
just like dozens and dozens of calls.

2378
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,440
Um, and I made $4,300 within my second

2379
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,360
or third month of doing YouTube and and

2380
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,280
consulting, right? And then I put that

2381
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,120
up to $1,000 and people still paying for

2382
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,440
that. And I made probably $15,000 off

2383
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:27,520
999 $997 calls um doing consulting. So

2384
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,120
there's different people pay for it. If

2385
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,960
you can get this up and running, that's

2386
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,239
how you get the money coming. But

2387
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:33,840
through warm outreach, I would recommend

2388
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,000
that you do it for free. Um, and build

2389
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,120
up until you're getting these really

2390
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,320
happy customers and you know that you're

2391
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,400
actually providing a good service. Um,

2392
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,480
so yeah, there's also things like ads,

2393
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,840
but um, for beginners, I wouldn't

2394
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,520
recommend you trying to own Facebook ads

2395
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,760
to just try and get some u get some

2396
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,719
clients. But I hope that makes sense.

2397
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,199
Knowledge gap. You're starting way down

2398
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,280
there. This is your process to get some

2399
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,040
kind of knowledge gap. And the way that

2400
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,880
you monetize this knowledge gap is

2401
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,199
through a kind of offer like this where

2402
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,960
you're just doing consultations to help

2403
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,560
them match up the best AI tools. You're

2404
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,080
selling other people's products. You're

2405
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,520
getting compensated through affiliates

2406
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,800
and then through passing these people

2407
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,040
off cuz you're doing the hard work

2408
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,640
of maybe not harder than actual

2409
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,000
implementation, but you're doing some

2410
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,440
good work here where you're actually

2411
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,159
you're moving them down from unaware or

2412
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,920
unfamiliar with AI to being more

2413
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,159
receptive to implementation. So, we

2414
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,480
found that if business owners don't

2415
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,239
understand the tech and understand that

2416
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,000
why it's good for their business and the

2417
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,520
fact that this what we're going to be

2418
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,199
building for you is actually really the

2419
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:35,120
best play for you right now, then

2420
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,239
there's no chance that they get to

2421
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:37,920
implementation and you can't sell. You

2422
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,400
can never sell 20, 30, $40,000 worth of

2423
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:44,239
AI uh for an AI project if they don't

2424
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:45,520
understand all of this stuff. So, you're

2425
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,280
doing a key part of the process and you

2426
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,960
can compensated by passing that off to

2427
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,480
people once they're ready. And of

2428
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,400
course, over time, you will build up

2429
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,520
more skills and you build up more

2430
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,600
experience. You may want to go into

2431
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,360
charging directly for this. Once you've

2432
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,120
got a better lead generation system, you

2433
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,880
can start charging for it. Maybe you put

2434
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,640
up a little education product as a lead

2435
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,560
magnet instead. You start running some

2436
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,760
traffic to the, you know, there's all

2437
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,960
these different players and you try to

2438
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,640
move down and and expand your offering.

2439
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,120
So, I started off I started off on

2440
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,280
YouTube making YouTube videos talking

2441
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,880
about the cool AI builds I saw. You can

2442
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,800
go and look at it on my channel. I was

2443
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,320
just doing what was interesting to me

2444
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,880
and building my knowledge gap and

2445
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,320
putting up coding tutorials and me

2446
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,840
building these different things. I loved

2447
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,440
it and and I realized there were lot

2448
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,120
there was a big market for it as well.

2449
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,960
Um and that's how kind of got my channel

2450
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,159
off the ground and built my knowledge

2451
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,840
gap and I started consulting. So I was

2452
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,679
technically educating on my channel and

2453
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:35,360
I started doing consulting like I said

2454
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,640
making lots of money off consulting

2455
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,000
within a few months of starting my

2456
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,040
YouTube channel. Um, and then I started

2457
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,880
at Morningside AI, my AI automation

2458
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,560
agency to do the implementation and

2459
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,320
basically capture more of the value

2460
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,000
that's possible within the AI space. It

2461
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,159
will come come a long way from me and my

2462
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,960
spare bedroom. Um, and I'm extremely

2463
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,320
proud of what we've done and I can't

2464
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,159
wait to hear about what all of you do.

2465
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,840
And I know I know I know it's so

2466
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,679
difficult to get off the starting box

2467
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:01,679
when you feel like you have absolutely

2468
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,840
no [ __ ] clue what to do. Like I I

2469
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,760
fully understand. I was in your position

2470
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,679
like six six years ago when I was

2471
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,960
starting an online business. I know how

2472
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,480
that feels and I'm just really trying I

2473
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,880
hope with this to give you that little

2474
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,040
nudge and that that small wind and the

2475
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,640
small steps that you need to start

2476
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,480
building a bit of momentum and really

2477
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,000
building your entrepreneurial skill set.

2478
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,440
So that's all for this video

2479
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,480
guys. If you're looking to use the AI

2480
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,320
space to build businesses to make money

2481
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,640
and to change your life generally then

2482
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,760
this video is probably the most

2483
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,199
important one you're going to watch this

2484
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:34,640
year. Um because in this video I'm

2485
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,840
breaking down five different ways that

2486
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,520
you can start an AI business using the

2487
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,679
same formula that I've used to change my

2488
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,360
life with it. So if you're not familiar

2489
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,120
with me or my channel, my name is Lee

2490
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,280
Mley and about a year and a half ago, I

2491
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,880
got into the AI space sensing that there

2492
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,560
was this big opportunity brewing and

2493
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,239
I've been able to over the past 18

2494
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,960
months go from literally zero in AI

2495
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,400
income to multiple six figures per month

2496
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,480
with me and my team. So, we've been able

2497
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,239
to come in and learn this AI space

2498
01:20:58,239 --> 01:20:59,600
rapidly, exactly how I'm going to share

2499
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,120
with you later on in this video, how to

2500
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,880
actually learn the stuff you need to

2501
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,640
build businesses in the AI space. Going

2502
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,080
to be teaching that and giving you a

2503
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,239
crash course and a step-by-step list on

2504
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,560
how to learn the stuff required for five

2505
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,840
different AI business models, which I'll

2506
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,239
share at the end. So, very important

2507
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,480
video. If you are serious about it, then

2508
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,679
watch this thing because this is the

2509
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,000
distillation of a year and a half of my

2510
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,239
learnings in the space and also the most

2511
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,239
recent styles of AI agencies, which is

2512
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:25,600
the model you're going to be learning

2513
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,040
that are actually working and and people

2514
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,560
are actually able to to make money with.

2515
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,719
So, going to start off with a little bit

2516
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,080
of more background. So, I'm going to rub

2517
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,520
this off. Give me a second. A little bit

2518
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,600
more background to actually making money

2519
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,520
with AI in general and how how you're

2520
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,960
able to do it. So, might people might

2521
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,000
think you need a an AI SAS, right?

2522
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,120
You're probably thinking, "Oh, I need to

2523
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,320
have like a really bright idea and I

2524
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,600
need to go and raise a bunch of money

2525
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,760
and make make this big thing out of it."

2526
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,520
Uh, no. We don't really want to do that

2527
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,880
because that's not accessible to most of

2528
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,120
us. I mean, I didn't have like a million

2529
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,639
dollars just sitting in the in this in

2530
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,320
the in the safe to to go and throw it at

2531
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,159
one of these startups or I didn't have

2532
01:21:58,159 --> 01:21:59,760
VC connections to go and get money. So

2533
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,840
SAS is kind of off the board immediately

2534
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,199
unless you do the kind of no code SAS

2535
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:05,280
route, etc. But generally, if you're

2536
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,120
looking to just get started in online

2537
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,880
business specifically, um it's going to

2538
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,239
be something closer to

2539
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:13,360
agency. And agency is when you're going

2540
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,280
to have clients who come and you pitch

2541
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,360
them on and say, "Hey, look, I can build

2542
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,920
that's a it's going to be a hammer. I

2543
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,600
can build this for you and then they

2544
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,080
give you money back for it." Right? So,

2545
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,600
you don't need any upfront cost. Well,

2546
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,280
there's some upfront cost for software,

2547
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,719
etc., but it's nothing like a SAS where

2548
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,000
you need potentially millions of dollars

2549
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,600
of funding to get it to get it off the

2550
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,080
ground properly. But agency business

2551
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,360
model, which I'm sure you're familiar

2552
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,880
with SMMA and all the all the other

2553
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,639
agency business models, there's a

2554
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,480
million of them, you're giving something

2555
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,760
to your client and they're paying you in

2556
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,520
return. So it's just client and and

2557
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,320
patron to some degree relationship. So

2558
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,320
beyond that, you also have in the AI

2559
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,560
space, but this is based on top of the

2560
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,840
need for AI solutions. So all of these

2561
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,199
business models need to be based on some

2562
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,960
kind of demand in the AI space and where

2563
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,560
money can actually be exchanged. So

2564
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,199
agency opportunity in the AI space is

2565
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,440
based on the fact that we have uh

2566
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,800
millions and millions of businesses and

2567
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,920
companies around the world who have

2568
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,199
money and they need and they're willing

2569
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,040
to invest in getting AI solutions for

2570
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,960
their business so they can out compete

2571
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,159
their competitors and actually benefit

2572
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,520
from some of the technologies. This is

2573
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,440
what the whole AI agency model that I've

2574
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,880
been talking about for over over a year

2575
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,400
now is about is this AI solutions demand

2576
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,320
which is is really rapidly growing um

2577
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,600
throughout the world. So secondly, aside

2578
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,600
from agency, you also have

2579
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:34,159
education. Now this is a massive need in

2580
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:37,199
the AI space right now as well. And if

2581
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,639
you're able to combine agency and

2582
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,400
education where it's educating your

2583
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,880
niche, there is so much money to be made

2584
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,639
collectively from this as well. So what

2585
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,000
I'm going to teach you is first of all,

2586
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,080
you can't educate anyone unless you've

2587
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,159
actually done the thing. So, I'm going

2588
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,679
to teach you how to start an agency and

2589
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:52,960
get off the ground and learn the stuff

2590
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,719
that will then allow you to also educate

2591
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,639
people. Uh, but the agency is really

2592
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,159
where you're going to have to start cuz

2593
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,880
if you're a LinkedIn AI guru who's all

2594
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,800
all they ever done is done consulting,

2595
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,000
no one's you're never going to be able

2596
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,840
to get paid a lot for that information

2597
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,679
because you simply don't know your [ __ ]

2598
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,560
So, uh, when it comes to starting an AI

2599
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,080
business, we don't really want to go the

2600
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,440
SAS route. We can't jump to consulting

2601
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,600
or education immediately cuz we don't

2602
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,880
really know anything. We haven't got any

2603
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,560
tangible proof of how we've been able to

2604
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,280
help businesses with AI and create

2605
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,639
value. So education you can't go to

2606
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:29,639
immediately but generally this is built

2607
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:33,960
on need for

2608
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,679
clarity that's a T/

2609
01:24:38,679 --> 01:24:40,880
strategy businesses and people all over

2610
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,400
the world are needing clarity and

2611
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,960
strategy on the AI space and everything

2612
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,560
that's happening in it. So education is

2613
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,920
still a massive opportunity for you. But

2614
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,280
it has to come down the line. You have

2615
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,480
to actually learn the thing and do the

2616
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,920
thing first or you're never going to be

2617
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,840
much of an educator. This could be in

2618
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,760
the real estate niche, could be any

2619
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,199
niche, you can cut it. There's a need

2620
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,120
for education. Whether you're doing like

2621
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,360
enterprise consulting on how to adapt AI

2622
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,840
to their dev teams, like there's so much

2623
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,760
there, but you first must start off with

2624
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,960
an agency, which is what I'm going to be

2625
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:07,840
talking about for the rest of this

2626
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,280
video. Okay? So we're not going SAS,

2627
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,560
we're not doing education. You got to

2628
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,480
start off with an agency. And now you

2629
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,239
get the three problems of starting an AI

2630
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:17,520
agency which I've painfully learned uh

2631
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,280
through myself and through all all the

2632
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,360
people in our our broader community.

2633
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,639
There's three problems that you have to

2634
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:23,760
solve when starting one of these

2635
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,600
agencies. And this is what exactly what

2636
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,080
my uh the five different strategies I'm

2637
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,040
going to give you at the end of this

2638
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,040
video are going to be based around. So

2639
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,760
five different types of AI agencies that

2640
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,000
occupy different types of niches and I'm

2641
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,280
going to give you the blueprint to start

2642
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,800
them. But you first need to understand

2643
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,239
that we have three problems when

2644
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:43,960
starting an AI agency. Firstly, you

2645
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,360
have expertise technical. So somewhere

2646
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,840
in your agency or your brain needs to be

2647
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,719
some kind of AI expertise. Understanding

2648
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,280
how to build things, how to use

2649
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,480
different software and different tools

2650
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,440
or even code yourself to build systems

2651
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,040
that create value with AI. So you have

2652
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,960
to have some kind of technical expertise

2653
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,480
and that's what we're going to be the

2654
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,760
step-by-step strategies that I'm giving

2655
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,440
you after this. That's what they really

2656
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,679
focus on on building up within a two to

2657
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,520
three month period. So, first thing you

2658
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,679
need expertise uh technical expertise

2659
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,360
either within your brain as the agency

2660
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,960
owner when you're starting out or you

2661
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,719
need to hire it and bring it in as a as

2662
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,400
a CTO, a lead developer or just as

2663
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,639
developers in general. Secondly, you

2664
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:25,239
need lead

2665
01:26:25,239 --> 01:26:27,600
flow. So, you need some way to generate

2666
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,280
leads and have them coming across your

2667
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,880
desk and reaching out to you to ask to

2668
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,639
work with you um or replying to your

2669
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:33,920
emails or however you're generating

2670
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,800
leads. And then

2671
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,199
finally, you need credibility/ authority

2672
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,360
cuz businesses are skeptical about AI

2673
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,199
right now. And if you can't provide some

2674
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,199
kind of reason as to why you you're the

2675
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,320
guy for the job and you can actually

2676
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,239
deliver what you say, uh they're not

2677
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,239
going to buy from you. So, uh you need

2678
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:53,040
to figure out a way to either tackle

2679
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,520
these problems one by one or to tackle

2680
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,040
them all at once, which is the strategy

2681
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,400
that I recommend and that I'm going to

2682
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,239
give you now. So, we need to somehow get

2683
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,840
technical expertise either in our brain

2684
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,679
or we need to hire it. We need to find

2685
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:05,600
some way of generating leads and

2686
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,199
bringing people to to in contact with

2687
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,719
our business and our services. And then

2688
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,239
we need the credibility and authority to

2689
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:12,000
close them. Like why I can actually do

2690
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,840
what I say I'm going to do. Why I know

2691
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,040
this is going to help your business and

2692
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,440
it's not just some AI hype crap that is

2693
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,480
actually just going to waste your time

2694
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,639
and money. So need to achieve all these

2695
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:22,239
three. Remember that. Okay. Now the

2696
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,880
strategy to solve this for most of you.

2697
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,239
So remember we need to solve all three

2698
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:27,760
of those problems as quickly and

2699
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,280
efficiently as possible and with the

2700
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,600
least amount of pain. Um there's always

2701
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,560
going to be pain, but we're going to try

2702
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,560
to do it with as little as possible.

2703
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,560
This is from my own experience and also

2704
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,639
from hundreds of people now in the

2705
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:40,320
community, broader community, um in the

2706
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,719
AI agency space, both free and paid

2707
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,000
community who are using something

2708
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,840
similar to this and were able to see

2709
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,159
success with it. So strategy revolves

2710
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:52,879
around one learn the

2711
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,520
thing and the

2712
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,199
thing is the area or specific type of

2713
01:28:00,199 --> 01:28:02,320
narrow expertise that you want to build

2714
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,199
within your agency first. So we've got I

2715
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:06,239
don't know how I'm going to draw this

2716
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,400
but

2717
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,800
uh you can

2718
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,440
have

2719
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,960
broad broad expertise where you have to

2720
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,760
know a toz everything about a subject

2721
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,760
and everything in between or you can

2722
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,960
just say I'm just going to

2723
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,199
learn this little bit and be an expert

2724
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,520
at

2725
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,199
that a lot easier initially it's going

2726
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,520
to take a lot less time for for in terms

2727
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,920
of my AI expertise over the past 18

2728
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,280
months I have started initially niche

2729
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,199
and and an expert in a small area which

2730
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:40,719
was originally custom knowledge chat

2731
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,719
bots if you guys remember that um way

2732
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,840
back in March last year I was making all

2733
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,280
these videos about how I can build these

2734
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,639
custom knowledge chat bots and giving

2735
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:49,840
you coding tutorials and all these

2736
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,199
business owners oh yeah can you build

2737
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,040
one of these for me so I started off

2738
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,040
niche and then through running my agency

2739
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,960
and making more videos and getting on

2740
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,800
calls with consulting calls with people

2741
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,280
I then

2742
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:03,120
slowly broadened my expertise to the

2743
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,560
point where now when it comes to AI

2744
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,560
solutions for businesses and and how AI

2745
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,480
can help them, it's a it's a very broad

2746
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,639
understanding of it. So you can't expect

2747
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,239
to start off broad, you need to start

2748
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,760
narrow, which is why I mean when we say

2749
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,840
learn the thing, when you see the five

2750
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,840
different niched agency strategies that

2751
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,840
you're going to get next, it's all about

2752
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,520
picking one area. So whether you are

2753
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,199
starting here and going, okay, I'm going

2754
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:24,880
to start there or I'm going here and I'm

2755
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,199
going to start here. We need to start

2756
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,960
somewhere niche and narrow and we're

2757
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,679
going to learn the thing. So that's step

2758
01:29:30,679 --> 01:29:35,320
one and simultaneously you want to

2759
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,159
share

2760
01:29:37,159 --> 01:29:39,400
your

2761
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,600
journey. So as you're learning the

2762
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,760
thing, you want to be documenting the

2763
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,600
learning of the thing. So I did this

2764
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,480
exact same thing over a year ago now

2765
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,080
when I started my channel. I came into

2766
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,840
the space really curious, really

2767
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,159
motivated, but I didn't have that I mean

2768
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,239
the LLM technology that like chat GBT is

2769
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:57,840
based on had only really just come out.

2770
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,679
And so I was starting at the starting

2771
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,360
blocks of basically everyone else. And I

2772
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,480
was only able to get to this point

2773
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,560
because of just rapid iteration and and

2774
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,400
a lot of output within the space. And

2775
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,080
you can do the exact same thing, but you

2776
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,159
need to be sharing the learning of this.

2777
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:12,400
So that builds up. So I'm getting a

2778
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,679
little bit ahead of myself, but if we

2779
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:15,520
share the journey in step three, we're

2780
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,719
then going to

2781
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,840
offer. Sorry, this will make sense in a

2782
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,920
second.

2783
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,679
So sharing your journey can mean

2784
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:33,320
YouTube, can mean

2785
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,000
LinkedIn, can mean any kind of medium.

2786
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,040
We've talked about a lot of these things

2787
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,760
on the channel. Uh but sharing the

2788
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,199
journey in some way is going to be

2789
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,679
building up a track record of your

2790
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,760
expertise and growth. And that's going

2791
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,600
to tie into uh I should probably have

2792
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,920
the the three

2793
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,560
things expertise um two lead flow and

2794
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,320
three. So this is the strategy to solve

2795
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,840
these three problems. By the way, you

2796
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,040
probably can't see the green very well,

2797
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,800
but you know what it says, expertise,

2798
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,080
lead flow, and authority,

2799
01:31:02,679 --> 01:31:04,960
credibility. So by learning the thing,

2800
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,400
you can then share your journey of

2801
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,440
learning the thing on these different

2802
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,040
platforms. And then when you offer free

2803
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,639
consulting calls, the interest that you

2804
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,880
generate by sharing your journey is

2805
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,000
going to allow you to convert some of

2806
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,639
that interest into actual uh buying

2807
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,000
attention. People are ready to start

2808
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,600
paying for you, paying for your services

2809
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,239
potentially. So, um, then you can go,

2810
01:31:23,239 --> 01:31:26,159
uh, close deals, right? Once you've got

2811
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,320
people on the phone, you'll find that

2812
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,840
purely if you do enough of them, there's

2813
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,800
going to be people who have money and

2814
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:31,840
are willing to pay for it. And they'll

2815
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,520
say, "Hey, look, would you be able to

2816
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,360
build me this? I'm willing to pay you

2817
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,159
for it." And that's when you can start

2818
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,639
to monetize on all this stuff here. So,

2819
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,719
coming back to the three problems, the

2820
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:43,760
expertise comes from learning the thing.

2821
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,520
The lead flow comes from sharing your

2822
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,840
journey and also the expertise is

2823
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,760
something you know you showing that you

2824
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,719
know what you're talking about is going

2825
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:51,840
to create that lead flow as well but

2826
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,520
it's the documenting it on YouTube or

2827
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,120
LinkedIn exactly how I've done it

2828
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,880
exactly how hundreds of other people are

2829
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,440
doing it now and the authority also

2830
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,320
comes from sharing your journey. So when

2831
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,159
they look back and you are 3 months down

2832
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:05,360
the line and you've been consistently

2833
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,679
posting information about uh one of

2834
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,040
these niche areas which we're going to

2835
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,679
go into later whether it's it's text

2836
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,040
based agents whether it's voice based

2837
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,320
agents these different areas where you

2838
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,159
can be an expert within a short space of

2839
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,679
time in the AI space you can be an

2840
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:19,679
expert in literally a month if you pick

2841
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,679
one specific tool so it's very easy to

2842
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,440
become an an expert you just need to

2843
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,760
actually put in the effort and and apply

2844
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,639
yourself for a prolonged period of time

2845
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,080
um once you've got all of these done

2846
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
you've got the expertise ticked off the

2847
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,199
default ticked off and the authority

2848
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:34,800
then you're able to start to close

2849
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,960
deals. So this is a way of attacking all

2850
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,239
three of these problems in one go. So

2851
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:42,159
within the space of 3 months you will

2852
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,560
learn the thing share the journey be be

2853
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,840
likely if you follow the strategy

2854
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,760
correctly be getting people booking in

2855
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,440
free consulting calls with you and that

2856
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,719
sets you up perfectly to be able to

2857
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:52,400
start closing deals solving all three of

2858
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,480
these problems.

2859
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,239
Now there is another way of doing it

2860
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:58,000
which we've kind of done as a community

2861
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,480
collectively over the past year and

2862
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,040
that's to learn the thing not to share

2863
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,440
the journey at all but get to 6 months

2864
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,000
down the line. Here we are 6 months

2865
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,560
after starting and you've learned the

2866
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,320
thing but now you've done absolutely

2867
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,000
nothing to share the thing and so you're

2868
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,360
at square one when it comes to marketing

2869
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,280
yourself and getting some lead flow

2870
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,600
which is problem number two. So, I would

2871
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,040
highly recommend you do these all

2872
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,760
simultaneously so that you can shortcut

2873
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,199
this thing to about 3 months and you

2874
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,400
have the attention you need to start

2875
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,920
closing some kind of deals. Okay. So,

2876
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,159
now we're going to get

2877
01:33:29,159 --> 01:33:32,600
into the actual five different

2878
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,800
strategies for starting. And so, what

2879
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,080
these are is a a type of AI agency you

2880
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,840
can start so that you can have a vehicle

2881
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,600
to learn and get deeper into the AI

2882
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,159
space. It's really all this stuff is

2883
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:46,080
about is making a bet on the AI space

2884
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,520
generally and just picking the right

2885
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,280
vehicle or horse within the space so

2886
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,440
that you can learn faster than everyone

2887
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,400
else cuz it's simply a level of

2888
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:57,679
expertise question. Who is the smartest

2889
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:59,360
and who is the most experienced in a

2890
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:01,440
certain space within the AI space might

2891
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,760
be the real estate AI guy. The only way

2892
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,360
that you're going to become the number

2893
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,880
one expert is by actually doing some

2894
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,679
kind of business and being active at the

2895
01:34:08,679 --> 01:34:12,239
space and the AI agency as a vehicle is

2896
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:14,960
what personally what I've used to get

2897
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,880
deeper into the space and learn. And for

2898
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,320
many of you, it's also going to be the

2899
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,239
best starting point um before you go on

2900
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,600
to re-education or whatever you want to

2901
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,440
do later. But whether you go into SAS as

2902
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,920
well, I've got my own AI SAS too, but

2903
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,320
the AI agency is what set me up for

2904
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,159
creating the SAS. So it all kind of

2905
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:32,560
stems from the agency at least in my

2906
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,480
experience. So you have these five

2907
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,080
different types and you might be a bit

2908
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,239
confused but give me a second. Uh five

2909
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,719
types of strategies you get the idea. So

2910
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:41,800
number

2911
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,480
one

2912
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,639
AI

2913
01:34:45,639 --> 01:34:48,080
automation specialist. So we have an AI

2914
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,639
automation specialist. Um let me write

2915
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:52,239
all of these out here first for you. So

2916
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:54,040
then we have two

2917
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,719
text based agent. I'm not they were all

2918
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:58,000
specialist. I'm not going to write it

2919
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,880
every time. Um, three, voice

2920
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:05,400
agent specialist. Four

2921
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,880
is Zapia ecosystem specialist. And I've

2922
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,440
run out of space here. Number five is

2923
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,000
chatbot specialist. So these are five

2924
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,040
different niched types of remember that

2925
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,760
little diagram I did that you got the

2926
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:27,678
broad and then you've got the

2927
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:30,400
niched. Now, this isn't this is niching

2928
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,520
your agency down by solution type, and

2929
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,120
you can always go broader at any point,

2930
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:36,719
but the idea is that it's easier to

2931
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:38,639
become an expert in a in a narrow area

2932
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,239
within a short space of time, and

2933
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,880
therefore be able to charge expert rates

2934
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,800
um than trying to be broad and taking a

2935
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,440
lot longer to be kind of a a mid-level

2936
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,600
intelligence or or understanding of the

2937
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,960
whole field. So, it's better to go deep

2938
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,199
initially and then over time you can

2939
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,679
broaden out to different areas. So these

2940
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:56,880
are basically starting blocks that I

2941
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,400
want to give you and just spoon feed

2942
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,000
you. I know the hardest thing when

2943
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,400
you're starting these businesses. I I

2944
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,719
started my e-commerce stores like four

2945
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:06,239
or five years ago and when I was getting

2946
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,320
started it was purely the analysis

2947
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,120
paralysis of having so many options and

2948
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,360
concerns about the sequence in which I

2949
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,800
should do them. I'm trying to just spoon

2950
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,320
feed this to you all. Here's five

2951
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,679
different ways and I'm going to give you

2952
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,840
stepby-step instructions so that you

2953
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,960
don't have to use your brain for the

2954
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,159
next 2 3 months. Learn the stuff. follow

2955
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:25,760
the process of sharing your journey as

2956
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,000
well and 90 95 90 ideally 100% of you

2957
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,080
are able to actually put some uh put

2958
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,679
some rubber to the road and progress in

2959
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,600
the space by using at least one of

2960
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,679
these. So going through these an AI

2961
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,320
automation specialist is different from

2962
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,000
a general AI agency because they're

2963
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,080
going to be specializing in specifically

2964
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,080
AI automations on things like make.com

2965
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,520
and air table. So this is primarily

2966
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:52,840
based around um make.com

2967
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,159
and Air

2968
01:36:55,159 --> 01:36:57,520
Table. So, these are the only tools you

2969
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,199
really need to learn to become an AI

2970
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:01,199
automation specialist. Um, and I've got

2971
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:02,320
some examples of guys who are

2972
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,679
successfully running these agencies as

2973
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:07,679
well. So, example one is uh Shaz, I'll

2974
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,760
put them up on screen. Shaz Matthews,

2975
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,119
great guy. He was out in Dubai with me

2976
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:13,119
recently for our recent AI agency

2977
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,040
mastermind. Um, Shaz is running a

2978
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,719
specifically AI automation focused

2979
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:19,360
agency. Um, we also have SJ, member of

2980
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,199
my accelerator, who's recently I had him

2981
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:22,400
recently on the channel, so I'll put

2982
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,920
that up here somewhere as well if you

2983
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,199
want to learn more about his story, but

2984
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:26,440
he's come in as a complete

2985
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,800
non-developer, decided to learnmake.com

2986
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,560
and is now making a supplementary income

2987
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,480
to his main job, which is equaling in

2988
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,840
some months is paying more than his

2989
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,639
actual job. So, SJ and Sha's two

2990
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:38,800
examples of AI automation specialists.

2991
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,159
And at the end of this video, I'm going

2992
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,520
to let you know how you can actually get

2993
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,840
the step by step. So, I've got about 6

2994
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,639
to 10 steps in each of these strategies

2995
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,239
that is available on a document that I'm

2996
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:49,600
going to give you at the end. So, if you

2997
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,880
want to get that, I'll be letting you

2998
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,000
know where to get it at the end, but I

2999
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,920
don't want to give that away too early.

3000
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,360
Right? So, each of these has attached to

3001
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,679
it like a 10step plan. So, if you're

3002
01:37:57,679 --> 01:37:59,119
interested in any of these at any point,

3003
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:00,960
then make sure you stick around for for

3004
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:05,520
that. textbased agents. We have um these

3005
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,040
are a little more complicated but the

3006
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,560
GPTs if you played around with open AI's

3007
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,280
chat GPT the GPTs uh feature that they

3008
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,639
released that's a consumerf facing

3009
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,560
textbased agents uh framework and and

3010
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,520
platform you also have the assistance

3011
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,840
API um so this is how you can build GPTs

3012
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,520
and and use them programmatically across

3013
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,119
anywhere in the world for to build into

3014
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:26,560
applications for your clients. So

3015
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,400
textbased agents are different from chat

3016
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,960
bots and that they are basically you're

3017
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,320
building custom chat GBT like

3018
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,320
experiences for your clients and that's

3019
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,760
free form that's open-ended that's

3020
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,000
conversational um you might be using

3021
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,199
tools you might be using custom

3022
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,119
knowledge these are like custom versions

3023
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,560
of chat GBT is the easiest way to think

3024
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,320
of these um I've actually built my

3025
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,880
software

3026
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:49,920
agent on top of this which allows you to

3027
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,920
make GBTs and put them on WhatsApp put

3028
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,159
them on websites etc. So I'm very big

3029
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:56,320
and also my agency morning side is very

3030
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,520
big in the check space agent space. Um

3031
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,040
this is something that I'm I'm really

3032
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,400
big on. I think this is a great place to

3033
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,960
start. Um but you guys can make your

3034
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,320
choice at the end when you get the when

3035
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,159
you get the step by step. So textbased

3036
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,480
agents you're building custom chatbt

3037
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,760
applications for your clients and

3038
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,119
putting them on WhatsApp putting them on

3039
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:16,239
websites various places and uh your

3040
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:19,119
buddies software also helps you do that.

3041
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:21,440
So, voice space agents, I'm sure you've

3042
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,560
heard, I've talked about a lot on the

3043
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,840
channel. I think the voice AI space is

3044
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,520
really just getting started and all of

3045
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,880
the other guys that are in my

3046
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,880
accelerator and and my close network,

3047
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,560
they're all making a a [ __ ] ton of money

3048
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,840
right now selling these voice AI

3049
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,560
solutions. Um, so the space is extremely

3050
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,040
hot. It's moving very quickly. If you

3051
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,880
wanted to jump in and become an expert,

3052
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,639
I've seen guys go in and be an expert

3053
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:44,639
within space of like 1 to 2 months of

3054
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:46,239
really applied effort in this. And if

3055
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,840
you get in the right circles, I mean,

3056
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,600
all of my friends that are selling these

3057
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,119
solutions are just freely sharing like,

3058
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,239
"Oh, this is what's working. This is

3059
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:53,840
what people are selling. Um, this is

3060
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,440
what people want to buy." So, this is a

3061
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,880
really good really good space to be in.

3062
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,719
You've got platforms like um Bland AI.

3063
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,960
Shout out the guys at Bland. Uh we've

3064
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,560
got um what is it?

3065
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:07,600
Airi. There's a there's a new one of

3066
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,600
these every week, so don't uh forgive me

3067
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,080
if I forget one. Um synth flow.

3068
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,000
Synth flow. There's a whole bunch of

3069
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
different platforms, right? There's a

3070
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,119
VP, heaps of different platforms you can

3071
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:22,560
learn. You can basically just pick one,

3072
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,239
decide to be good at it, and the

3073
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:25,840
step-by-step strategy that I I'll give

3074
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,840
to you has a ton of excellent resources

3075
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,280
that are all on YouTube. All the

3076
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,719
resources that I'm providing, and the

3077
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:31,840
step-by-step guides are going to be

3078
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,360
free. Um, voice based agent space going

3079
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,119
to be huge, really popping off right

3080
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:39,760
now. Um, great place to be in in my

3081
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,840
opinion. And you have the the Zapia

3082
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,239
ecosystem. We have some examples

3083
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,080
actually of these guys. So we have SHs

3084
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,639
and SJ we're doing AI automation um

3085
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,480
agency specifically focused on the AI

3086
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:54,840
automation space. Then we have myself

3087
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,520
Morningside. My agency is primarily

3088
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,840
focused on this through our own

3089
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:01,440
software. Um so we focus on textbased

3090
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:05,159
agents primarily. Also have

3091
01:41:05,159 --> 01:41:08,000
Isaiah member of my accelerator original

3092
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,239
member of my community. Um, and he's

3093
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:12,080
selling textbased agents, AI appointment

3094
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,760
setters for Instagram DMs. I've recently

3095
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:14,800
done an interview with him on the

3096
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,840
channel if you want to learn more about

3097
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,480
how he I think he's making $25,000 a

3098
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,080
month now on that. And that's soon to be

3099
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,199
more. If you want to watch that,

3100
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:23,280
there'll be tag somewhere up there.

3101
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,280
Isaia's doing very well. Myself and the

3102
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,760
team selling agents to Agent doing very

3103
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,159
very well as well. Voicebased agents, we

3104
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,679
have guys like uh

3105
01:41:32,679 --> 01:41:34,440
Mark and

3106
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:37,440
Taha. I've had Mark on the channel um a

3107
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,119
long time ago, but I'll actually link

3108
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:40,239
their channels down below if you want to

3109
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:41,360
check them out and they're going to be

3110
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,560
linked all through these documents as

3111
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,840
well. So, scrap the description. They're

3112
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,880
going to be all through these documents,

3113
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,400
but examples of people who are

3114
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,679
successfully running these types of

3115
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,280
agencies are going to be in the document

3116
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,520
as well. So, Mark and Taha, Giannis,

3117
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,880
I'll pop him up screen. You guys might

3118
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,639
know Jiannis by now, good friend of

3119
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:56,080
mine, and he's really crushing it in the

3120
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:59,199
space using voice agents. Then the Zapia

3121
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:02,000
ecosystem is an interesting play because

3122
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,320
the Zapia ecosystem has got so much to

3123
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,920
it now. There's tables, there's uh

3124
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,119
there's zaps in general, there's

3125
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,280
canvases, there's chat bots, there's so

3126
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,280
much crammed into the Zappy ecosystem

3127
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,800
and it's all no code as well. So, if

3128
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:13,920
you're looking to just get started in

3129
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,119
the space and really get eased into AI

3130
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:18,480
and automation and and building these

3131
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,480
agencies, the Zappy ecosystem is a good

3132
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,320
way to just block out all the [ __ ]

3133
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,159
and all the noise and just say this

3134
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:26,159
place which is very well doumented, huge

3135
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,000
community, great support, I'm going to

3136
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,760
just focus on this area. So if you're

3137
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,280
com if you're really concerned about the

3138
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,560
technical nature of building some of

3139
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,560
these solutions, voice agents can get a

3140
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:35,920
little bit gnarly on the code if you're

3141
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,719
doing things like Vappy textbased agents

3142
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,400
uh when you're doing custom integrations

3143
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,000
to different platforms can get a little

3144
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,840
bit gnarly. Um and doing custom

3145
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:47,280
front-end interfaces AI automation not

3146
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,679
usually too bad. Um this is probably a

3147
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:50,960
good place to start as well if you're

3148
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,679
bit concerned about that. But the Zappy

3149
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:55,760
ecosystem generally being a like

3150
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,840
fundamentally no code platform is a

3151
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,679
great place to get started. So you can

3152
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:01,719
build um on

3153
01:43:01,719 --> 01:43:04,719
here

3154
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:08,520
automations, chat

3155
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:12,800
bots, you can have like data

3156
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,520
management. So you can integrate AI into

3157
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,159
all of these and be creating value with

3158
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,080
AI through the through the Zapia

3159
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,480
platform. So, good place to look into if

3160
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,400
you're concerned about the the the

3161
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,000
development or the coding nature of a

3162
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,560
lot of these solutions. I I personally,

3163
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,080
if I was starting off brand new, I would

3164
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,199
be seriously looking at the Zappy

3165
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:34,480
ecosystem cuz they're building a lot of

3166
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,679
cool stuff as well. So, it's good. It's

3167
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:37,360
a good long-term bet. And Zappy has also

3168
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,119
got Zapia Central, which I talked about

3169
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:41,239
on the channel uh

3170
01:43:41,239 --> 01:43:43,199
Central talked about on the channel

3171
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,840
recently, and it's their AI hub for

3172
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,239
creating AI agents through Zappia. And

3173
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:49,840
again, all no code. So, it's like this

3174
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,440
but easier. So, Zappy is a very good

3175
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,960
thing to to be looking into if you are

3176
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,040
concerned about the the uh development

3177
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,239
side of things. Should probably jump

3178
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:58,880
over this way. Finally, chatbot

3179
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,520
specialist. So, this is different to

3180
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,360
textbased agents. Um, I'm going to make

3181
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:04,639
a video on the difference between chat

3182
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,719
bots and agents um soon because I

3183
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,639
probably should just make that clear.

3184
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,440
Um, but cliff notes, textbased agents

3185
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,840
are these chat chatbt style experiences

3186
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,320
that are open-ended. You can ask them

3187
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,600
endless questions. They might have

3188
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:18,719
knowledge pulled in. They might have

3189
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,320
tools pulled in, but it's it's

3190
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,239
fundamentally an open-ended and

3191
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:25,199
conversational interaction. Chatbot

3192
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:27,920
building is more so focused on uh things

3193
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,360
like voice flow. And I've talked about

3194
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,520
voice flow for over a year now. And

3195
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,040
that's my go-to chatbot building

3196
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,400
platform. And I differentiate these from

3197
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,880
textbased agents. And that chat bots I

3198
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,440
need to program and design uh piece by

3199
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,719
piece. And I have to build all the

3200
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:42,159
logic. If I don't build the logic, it's

3201
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:43,920
not going to be there. So it needs to be

3202
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,239
like, okay, well, if this comes in and

3203
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,800
we do something here, Da da da. Okay.

3204
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,080
Well, it's either going to go up here or

3205
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,760
it's going to go down here where you've

3206
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,679
got much more of a structured layout and

3207
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:55,520
control over the flow and functionality.

3208
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,639
So, if you don't build it, it's not

3209
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:58,760
going to be in there. But with textbased

3210
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:01,119
agents, you don't need to program.

3211
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:02,480
There's no programming like this. You

3212
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,560
program it at the prompt level. So, when

3213
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:05,920
you write your little prompt for the

3214
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,000
agent, that's the programming of the

3215
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,920
textbased agent. Here, you actually need

3216
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,000
to program it by telling them what to do

3217
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,639
when XYZ happens. Right? So, these are a

3218
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,719
little bit different. They're not worse.

3219
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:18,800
they are in some cases you want more

3220
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,239
control over the solution that you're

3221
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:21,600
building and and the functionality

3222
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,119
within it. Sometimes these are a little

3223
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:25,760
bit too wild and and unhinged to to get

3224
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,880
the functionality that your client

3225
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,880
wants. Um and also these can include

3226
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,400
buttons and things like this and buttons

3227
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,159
make it easier and better to use for

3228
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,000
your customers in various circumstances.

3229
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,400
So chatbot specialist still a very valid

3230
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,639
one to to be looking into. Um, I think

3231
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:42,400
the the voice flow to

3232
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,960
WhatsApp because you can put a WhatsApp

3233
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,400
app with all these buttons and it can do

3234
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,239
things. The the automation of all the

3235
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:50,239
all a key business's processes with

3236
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,639
WhatsApp via voice flow I think is is a

3237
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:54,159
great stack to get started. You can look

3238
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:57,040
at any any business you can basically

3239
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,960
walk into and go say hi to. You can try

3240
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:00,320
to take the core functions of that

3241
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,239
whether it's booking a table, reserving,

3242
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:04,480
meeting the meeting a designer or or

3243
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,080
meeting the team etc. can all be put

3244
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,000
into some kind of voice flow chatbot

3245
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,600
that you can be then be put on WhatsApp.

3246
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,679
I mean Americans, you're a bit behind on

3247
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:12,880
the WhatsApp buzz, but the rest of the

3248
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:15,199
world is is very very uh eager to to be

3249
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:16,480
adopting things like this. So for

3250
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,719
chatbot specialists, a great example of

3251
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,840
this is big man Brendan. I'll put his

3252
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:25,119
channel. You may have seen him. Brendan

3253
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:27,040
Jawat, Australian guy, smashing in the

3254
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,480
space doing some really great tutorials.

3255
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,760
So if you want to check out his channel,

3256
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,199
that'll be linked on the uh on the

3257
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:33,520
document for this particularly. Um, but

3258
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,400
those are the five different

3259
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:39,360
types. And again, these are narrow in

3260
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,600
entry points to the space as a whole.

3261
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,679
So, you might decide, I'm going to

3262
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,600
master this and this and get really good

3263
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,440
at it and that's going to be my entry

3264
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,639
point and I'm going to make those the

3265
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:50,000
first solutions that I sell. And over

3266
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,440
time, you can broaden and take on

3267
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,119
different challenges. But you need to

3268
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:54,239
start somewhere. And the reason a lot of

3269
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:57,040
you aren't starting is because you don't

3270
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,040
have a clear, you aren't able to to

3271
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,560
cross off the alternatives. You're

3272
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,000
looking at, oh, voice stuff. Oh, text

3273
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
stuff. Oh, I need to also do make an

3274
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,679
make an air table. I'm trying to give

3275
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:06,600
you

3276
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:10,159
a focused road map for 2 to 3 months so

3277
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:11,440
that you can actually get a start in the

3278
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,639
space and be able to cross some of these

3279
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:15,440
alternatives off. So, in order to get

3280
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,880
the step-by-step guides for each of

3281
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,280
these, it's between six to 10 steps and

3282
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,520
resources. So, it might be free online

3283
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,360
courses. It might be v videos that I've

3284
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,119
made or my my friends have made. some of

3285
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:27,760
these guys here. It's going to walk you

3286
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:29,520
through even free resources from places

3287
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:32,639
like make that has the uh that have

3288
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:34,400
their ownmies and things like this. So,

3289
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:37,199
I've curated over the space of uh like a

3290
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,880
couple of days the best resources for

3291
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,159
learning each of these and put them into

3292
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,400
a sequence for you. So, all of this is

3293
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,639
going to be available because I I can't

3294
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:46,400
really like throw it all at you in the

3295
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,639
description. I'm going to make a post on

3296
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:50,400
my school. So, I've got a free school

3297
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,600
community. If you're interested in

3298
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,840
building AI businesses, then my my

3299
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,040
school community is kind of the place to

3300
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:58,159
be. Um, I'm in there doing free Q&As's

3301
01:47:58,159 --> 01:48:00,400
uh once a week and the rest of the

3302
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:01,600
community are all actively building

3303
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,400
their own AI agencies, consultancies,

3304
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,639
uh, SAS's, all of the the good stuff

3305
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:07,920
that you want to be around if you're

3306
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,600
serious about using this this

3307
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,119
opportunity. So, that's really all it

3308
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:12,719
is. And I'm going to be talking about

3309
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:16,080
this a lot more uh on my channel, but

3310
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,400
how I've been able to do some pretty

3311
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,000
cool stuff with my life since I I got

3312
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,800
into the space. It's been 18 months and

3313
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,119
I've I've built quite possibly the the

3314
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:26,960
dream life that I' I've always wanted. I

3315
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,040
have all of my friends here in Cape Town

3316
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,239
at the moment. We're all working

3317
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:32,000
together. My whole thing was always just

3318
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,440
cool [ __ ] with cool people and I've been

3319
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,360
able to achieve that. And the more

3320
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,199
people that I can get to use this

3321
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:38,800
opportunity to achieve that for

3322
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,280
themselves is uh is the ideal outcome

3323
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,040
for for me. And if I can make videos at

3324
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,800
this and wave my hands around and make

3325
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,000
that happen in other people's lives,

3326
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,040
then that's something I'm pretty proud

3327
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,440
of and more than happy to spend an hour

3328
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,719
waving my hands around in front of a

3329
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:53,280
whiteboard for. And of course, there's

3330
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,040
massive incentives for myself as well.

3331
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:58,400
If I'm able to educate you guys

3332
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,719
appropriately and get you successful, I

3333
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,320
also have software. And if you use my

3334
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:05,080
software to build your

3335
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,440
agencies, then I can make a lot of money

3336
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,920
as well. So the whole point is that I

3337
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,520
introduce you to this stuff. At some

3338
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:12,719
point, you might end up using my

3339
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:14,000
software and that'll help you to make

3340
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
more money and then we all win, right?

3341
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,239
So that's the that's the agreement we

3342
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:19,600
have on this channel. But if you want to

3343
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:22,040
get access to all of this, it is on the

3344
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:24,400
school free to join. It'll be in the

3345
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,000
description. And if you go to the

3346
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,719
YouTube resources, um it's a little tab

3347
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,400
on school. Once you get in, it should

3348
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,840
you should get let in within 10 15

3349
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,360
minutes or so. There'll be a little tab

3350
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:34,960
called YouTube resources and you click

3351
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,480
on that and you find the title of this

3352
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,239
video. There'll be a whole post and in

3353
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:39,760
there I will have linked to all of the

3354
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:40,880
resources for all these different

3355
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,280
strategies.

3356
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:45,040
So, no excuse now. You got to get

3357
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:48,080
started. Um, that's it's it's real. It's

3358
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,239
it's real. I'm living proof of it. And

3359
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:51,280
there are so many other people in the

3360
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,400
community. I've interviewed ton of them

3361
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:55,840
on my channel now. if you want to use

3362
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,760
this AI thing for your benefit and to

3363
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,159
actually not miss like it sounds so

3364
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:01,760
cringe and cliche but not to miss this

3365
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,920
one again like we get these once every 5

3366
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:06,880
10 years right usually 10 and this is

3367
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:10,880
the one so use it that's

3368
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:15,040
all today I wanted to make a quick video

3369
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,639
breaking down the different phases of

3370
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:19,280
scaling your AI automation agency from 0

3371
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,920
to $100,000 per month can be broken down

3372
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:24,000
into five different stages I've made a

3373
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,360
nice little presentation here for you to

3374
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,800
walk through through and it's more so

3375
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,159
for talking about okay what are the

3376
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,360
problems you're facing and where should

3377
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,800
your focus be on at each of these

3378
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,159
different phases and what kind of team

3379
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:33,920
and hiring requirements are needed at

3380
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,040
each phase. So I'm basically going to

3381
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,719
break down what your team should look

3382
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:39,360
like at each stage say 0 to 5k or 10 to

3383
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,520
20k and also the tech stack you're going

3384
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,880
to be using. I'm going to be covering

3385
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,000
everything at each of these different

3386
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,920
phases because I know I get a lot of

3387
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,080
questions about, okay, I'm how do I get

3388
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,360
to the next phase? What am I missing?

3389
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,560
Like, what's the main blocker in my

3390
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,080
business? And I've been through this

3391
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,080
process of of scaling from 0 to 100,000

3392
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,840
and more a month. And I'm going to break

3393
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,440
down what's been super helpful for me.

3394
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,280
This is going to be more so focused on a

3395
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,360
general agency. Um, so this is assuming

3396
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,280
that you're just doing purely custom AI

3397
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,440
development as an AI automation agency

3398
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,280
for your clients. Um, there are changes

3399
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,800
that occur if you move to a more niched

3400
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,000
model, but I'm just going to keep it

3401
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,840
pretty clearcut with this and just say

3402
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,600
if you're doing all general development,

3403
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:14,719
this is what it's going to look like.

3404
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,239
So, there's five different stages. We

3405
01:51:16,239 --> 01:51:18,000
can jump into it here. The first phase

3406
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,400
is called startup. Um, and that's from 0

3407
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,360
to $5,000 per month. Um, so your team in

3408
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,800
this case is going to be, if you're a

3409
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,159
non-technical founder, we're going to

3410
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:27,840
split this into two, especially in these

3411
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,719
early phases. Um, a nontechnical founder

3412
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:32,800
starting an AI automation agency is a

3413
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,320
bit of a different route to a technical

3414
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,760
founder. So you can see here if you are

3415
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,599
a non-technical founder as in you're

3416
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:39,040
someone who's coming into the AI field

3417
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,719
wanting to build a business but you

3418
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:42,719
don't have the technical background

3419
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,320
you're not a developer and we get a lot

3420
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:45,520
of developers coming into the field

3421
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:46,719
trying to start these as well. So I want

3422
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:47,920
to make sure I'm addressing both sides

3423
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,000
of this. If you're non-technical then

3424
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,320
your first team or the first person that

3425
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,000
you're going to hire in this case you're

3426
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
going to be using a a contractor will be

3427
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,159
a freelance AI developer and this will

3428
01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:00,159
be at a revenue share basis or you can

3429
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:01,679
either do it at cost depending on what

3430
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:03,679
setup it is. basically because you don't

3431
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:05,440
have the technical expertise yourself.

3432
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,880
You can't go out there and deliver these

3433
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,320
first few projects to get yourself off

3434
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,760
the ground. In the case of the technical

3435
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,440
founder, it's basically just going to be

3436
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,199
you and you are the lead developer of

3437
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:14,480
your agency. You're basically just a

3438
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,560
freelancer at this point. But that

3439
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:17,840
should be pretty straightforward for you

3440
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,199
technical guys. But for those of you who

3441
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:21,040
are non-technical going into a place

3442
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,480
like my free school community, which

3443
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,400
we've just hit 100,000 members on, which

3444
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,920
is incredible. So, thank you guys for

3445
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:27,920
the support on that. Um, but there's

3446
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,520
100,000 people in there. A significant

3447
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,599
portion of those guys are AI developers

3448
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,040
who are looking for work. So go in there

3449
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:34,719
to the hiring tab. You can look for,

3450
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:36,960
hey, I'm starting an agency. I have XYZ

3451
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,320
leads through my warm connections, which

3452
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,239
we're going to touch on in a second. And

3453
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:42,000
I'm looking for someone to uh pass off

3454
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,119
some of these projects to, and we're

3455
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:44,880
going to do a revenue share basis. Now,

3456
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,040
for all the costs of these different uh

3457
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,880
hires, and in this case, the split, I'm

3458
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,000
going to be breaking it down at the end

3459
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,080
of the video, a full table of all of the

3460
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,679
costs, at least starting cost for each

3461
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:55,520
of the roles I'm going to mention. So I

3462
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:56,960
I didn't want to clog up this slide. So

3463
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,159
I'm going to break that down at the end

3464
01:52:58,159 --> 01:52:59,679
and you guys can sort of screenshot it

3465
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:01,280
and use it for your hiring moving

3466
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:02,400
forward. So starting off as a

3467
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,760
nontechnical founder, you've got that

3468
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,440
freelance AI developer where you're

3469
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:06,800
going to work with. Now when it comes to

3470
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,400
the focus at this phase of your journey,

3471
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,840
it's going to be on warm outreach and

3472
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,520
finding your first free clients through

3473
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,639
your existing network and then

3474
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,239
eventually graduating towards paid

3475
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:15,840
clients through your existing network.

3476
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,920
So that's using the warm outreach method

3477
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:18,960
that I've talked about time and time

3478
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,239
again. I'll put it in the description.

3479
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:22,320
It's one. It's really, really good. Um,

3480
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,920
but that warm outreach strategy is going

3481
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:25,440
to allow you to find your first few

3482
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,040
clients and really just get some

3483
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,560
experience and get off the ground. And

3484
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:30,320
the big focus of this startup phase is

3485
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,920
really just building your confidence and

3486
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,760
experience gradually. Just slowly like

3487
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,840
baby baby steps to build your confidence

3488
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,280
and experience because like you like

3489
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,040
this quote here says at this stage

3490
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,760
you're likely feeling like I'm

3491
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,880
inexperienced. I'm unskilled and I'm

3492
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,400
struggling to really just wrap my head

3493
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,159
around this business and how it works.

3494
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:48,000
I'm taking things one step at a time in

3495
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,520
order to ease me into things. And this

3496
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,800
is the most important thing in this

3497
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,880
phase is just gradually and slowly

3498
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,320
easing into things and not trying to

3499
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,960
take this 10 $15,000 project or thinking

3500
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,159
you're going to have this fully

3501
01:53:58,159 --> 01:53:59,440
productized offering or I'm going to

3502
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:02,000
build a SAS or something. It's just just

3503
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,320
start small and gradually gradually

3504
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,159
build up your confidence and experience.

3505
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:07,599
Um, now when it comes to your tech stack

3506
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,199
to get started, you can use Slack. You

3507
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:10,639
could even use WhatsApp just to work

3508
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:12,000
with your warm connections for these

3509
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,840
first few clients. I put down Slack cuz

3510
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,119
it's good practice to get familiar with

3511
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:16,480
it, but Slack is of course going to cost

3512
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,320
you a bit of money. But Slack, Google

3513
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,000
Meet, Google Calendar, Calendarly, which

3514
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,159
will cost you 20 $30 a month initially,

3515
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:23,760
I think. And then Stripe. So that's your

3516
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,520
tech stack starting off at this point.

3517
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:26,960
And then we have the estimated cost and

3518
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,719
profit margins at this phase. And this

3519
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:29,920
is going to be based off the revenue

3520
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,440
share model if you're doing a 20%

3521
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,520
revenue share and you're making 5K per

3522
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,880
month. Then your cost will be around

3523
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,480
$1,000 per month, which is going to your

3524
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,880
freelance AI developer in exchange for

3525
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,239
uh their services and helping you

3526
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:41,760
fulfill those projects. So that startup

3527
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,280
phase just purely focusing on getting

3528
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,800
things off the ground and building a

3529
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,159
little bit of momentum and experience.

3530
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:48,080
The next phase is phase two called early

3531
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,920
growth. And this is from $5 to $10,000

3532
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,280
per month. The team that you have in

3533
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,960
this early growth phase of your journey.

3534
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:54,960
It's going to be one, two, or even three

3535
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,040
freelance AI developers like you had in

3536
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,880
the startup phase, but this time you're

3537
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,000
going to have more of them to choose

3538
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,440
from. As you start to get more leads

3539
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,800
coming through your warm connections, as

3540
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,320
you share some of the things that you're

3541
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,760
doing from that startup phase with them

3542
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:06,800
and say, "Hey, this is what we've

3543
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,080
built." You're going to see a lot more

3544
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,760
things sort of shaken out of the trees.

3545
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,840
And as you get more of these leads in

3546
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,840
coming, you need to expand your ability

3547
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,119
to deliver on those. and that's going to

3548
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:16,880
be with more than one developer. And so

3549
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,159
by going into the free community and

3550
01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:20,080
getting one or two more freelance AR

3551
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,360
developers that you have a relationship

3552
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:23,520
with will allow you to take these these

3553
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,040
incoming warm leads and and sort of get

3554
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,800
a statement of work together and say hey

3555
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:27,840
look this is what we're going to build.

3556
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,520
Are you interested like can you make me

3557
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,360
a bit of a proposal or say like why you

3558
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:32,880
should get this project and then you can

3559
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,159
say okay great let's move forward we'll

3560
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:36,000
do a revenue share on this 20 to 30%

3561
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,599
depending on how good they are and the

3562
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:38,719
size of the project and things like

3563
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:40,000
that. And at the same time you should

3564
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,920
also be hiring a virtual assistant or a

3565
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,000
VA. Um, this is going to be really your

3566
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,159
admin support to help you to start to

3567
01:55:46,159 --> 01:55:48,400
build your first set of systems and

3568
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:49,840
scale your warm outreach in this case.

3569
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,280
So, you can see the focus is here

3570
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,960
scaling your warm outreach. So, this

3571
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,239
means instead of you doing all of the

3572
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:55,679
messaging and follow-ups manually, you

3573
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:57,360
have to do quite a lot of tracking to

3574
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,080
make sure you're doing this

3575
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,679
systematically and not just doing kind

3576
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:01,280
of willy-nilly. the virtual assistant.

3577
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,639
The first role of that is going to be

3578
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:04,000
coming in is to help you manage that

3579
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,599
warm outreach process, making sure that

3580
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:06,800
you are reaching out to enough people

3581
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,480
per day and making sure that you are

3582
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,159
also sending follow-ups and and tracking

3583
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:11,280
the conversations and saying, "Hey,

3584
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,800
look, this person's ready for a call,

3585
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,320
etc." Having a bit of help so that

3586
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,159
you're not constantly in the DMs all day

3587
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:18,239
or or emailing people constantly. Having

3588
01:56:18,239 --> 01:56:19,440
a virtual assistant who can help you

3589
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,280
with that is a big step and first step

3590
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,480
towards you really building some

3591
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,639
acquisition systems. As you see here, uh

3592
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:26,080
the quote for this phase is, "I'm

3593
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,440
getting the hang of things, but it still

3594
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,280
feels like chaos. I'm setting up my

3595
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,719
first acquisition system that runs while

3596
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:32,320
I sleep and learning how to manage

3597
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:33,920
projects. So, the virtual assistant

3598
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,679
coming in to help you with that warm

3599
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:37,119
outreach and scaling of the warm

3600
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:38,880
outreach is key so that you can keep the

3601
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:40,880
the lead flow coming in. And the other

3602
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:42,639
focus for you in this period is to start

3603
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:44,239
creating content and sharing the client

3604
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:46,560
wins from phase one and phase two um to

3605
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,080
build your authority and credibility in

3606
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,679
the in the public eye basically. So,

3607
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:50,960
starting the long journey of content

3608
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,800
creation here is key because it's going

3609
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,400
to take a decent amount of time before

3610
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,520
you actually start seeing some results

3611
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,119
from it. So, kicking it off here is key.

3612
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:58,639
The text stack remains basically the

3613
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:00,400
same, just adding on make or zap here

3614
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,840
for any internal automations that you

3615
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,840
need to set up and also for notion for

3616
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,679
internal documentation. So that's the

3617
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:07,440
early growth phase. And as for cost and

3618
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:08,880
profit margins, you're looking at around

3619
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,199
$3,000 per month at that 10k mark

3620
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:12,239
because you're going to be paying

3621
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:14,880
roughly 30% of your uh revenue to these

3622
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,560
developers as part of their rev share.

3623
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,239
So the next phase is establishment and

3624
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:20,000
this is going from 10 to 20k per month.

3625
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,280
This phase is really one of the most

3626
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,719
difficult ones to get right, but also

3627
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:24,400
the the thing that really unlocks you to

3628
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:26,159
scale much further because as you can

3629
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:27,520
see by the team here, we are moving from

3630
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:30,080
a set of freelancers to having your own

3631
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,360
team of developers. And from my

3632
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:32,480
experience, you're going to be needing a

3633
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,639
senior AI developer who is full-time.

3634
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:36,080
You're going to be needing a junior AI

3635
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:37,760
developer who's also full-time and then

3636
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:39,040
your virtual assistant. and you'll be

3637
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,199
throwing in a bookkeeper here um who can

3638
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:42,639
do sort of part-time or contract work

3639
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:44,560
for you just to start to to manage the

3640
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,560
the finances of the business so that you

3641
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,000
aren't so stuck in and payroll and

3642
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,440
managing all of the the day-to-day

3643
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,960
finances which can start to get pretty

3644
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,719
burdensome around this phase. The shift

3645
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,880
from using a a gaggle of freelancers to

3646
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:56,639
help deliver your projects to having

3647
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:58,800
full-time AI developers in your company

3648
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:01,280
is such a massive leap forward because

3649
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,199
if anyone's worked with freelancers

3650
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:04,880
before of any sort, you know that

3651
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:06,000
particularly if you're finding good ones

3652
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,520
off Upwork, we found this very early on

3653
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,000
at Morningside by using Upwork devs or

3654
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,199
just getting started cuz we didn't have

3655
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:12,880
any clue how else to get them. But you

3656
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,639
you become basically client number nine

3657
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:16,159
in the list particularly with guys who

3658
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,440
are well ranked or guys and girls who

3659
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,880
are wellranked and they're getting a lot

3660
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,239
of interest on platforms like Upwork.

3661
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:21,360
And so unless you're finding really

3662
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,040
low-key freelancers through my free free

3663
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,239
community, which I'd say there's a good

3664
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:25,760
chance of getting them, in most cases,

3665
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,040
really good freelancers are going to

3666
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,560
have multiple projects going at once,

3667
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:29,920
which means that in some cases, you're

3668
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,199
going to be bottom of their priority

3669
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:33,520
list. Um, which results in all sorts of

3670
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,280
issues with client communications, um,

3671
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,960
or them really just phoning it in, doing

3672
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,800
the bare minimum, and then that all of

3673
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,159
that heat from the client comes on to

3674
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:41,360
you and like, hey, why is this person

3675
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:43,440
not responding? Like, why is this not up

3676
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:45,199
to scratch? So, this becomes the issue

3677
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:46,800
with scaling with freelancers. And I

3678
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,639
cannot stress enough how important it is

3679
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:50,320
to get some AI developers who are

3680
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,920
working for you full-time. It's like the

3681
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,520
only thing you're working on is our

3682
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,119
client projects and the quality work

3683
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:56,560
just goes through the roof once you make

3684
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,320
the shift as a non-technical AI

3685
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,480
automation agency founder. These senior

3686
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,080
AI devs are basically the ones who are

3687
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:03,440
architecting the builds for you. It's

3688
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,800
really a case of there being two sides

3689
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,639
to a lot of the AI development you guys

3690
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:08,239
will do through your agencies. And the

3691
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:10,080
first is sort of understanding the needs

3692
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,599
of the client and okay translating that

3693
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:12,880
to how we're going to approach it.

3694
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:15,520
research the architecture. This planning

3695
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,880
how you're going to approach the builds

3696
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,800
is a significant part of the work. And

3697
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,320
then after that, the rest is just the

3698
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,840
doing and sort of executing on what you

3699
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,520
said. You throw in a little bit there of

3700
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:24,880
also troubleshooting. Okay, when

3701
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:25,920
something doesn't happen, who's the

3702
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:27,199
brain power that's going to try to solve

3703
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:29,360
it? And that's why you need a senior AI

3704
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,040
developer. Someone who does have that

3705
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,760
capability to architect the the system

3706
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,520
to work work with the client and

3707
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:36,480
understand what they're trying to get

3708
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,000
out of it and to then communicate that

3709
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,080
to in this case your junior AI developer

3710
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:41,679
for them to do a lot of the grunt work

3711
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:43,280
so that your senior AI developer can

3712
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:44,880
handle a lot of other work themselves

3713
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,320
and pass off the grunt work to the

3714
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,760
junior AI developer. So that's that

3715
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,520
junior and senior dynamic and the split.

3716
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,040
Again, I go into way more detail on

3717
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,800
these kinds of developers in my hiring

3718
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:54,480
guide for developers. I'll put that in

3719
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,920
the description. But your senior AI

3720
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,360
developer is really key hire. your

3721
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:58,960
junior AI developer to do all the leg

3722
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,719
work as a key hire, both full-time

3723
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:02,159
virtual assistant to keep helping you

3724
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:03,679
with admin tasks and of course your

3725
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:05,040
bookkeeper to handle those finances.

3726
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,480
Your focus as the founder in this phase

3727
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,840
is going to be scaling that content

3728
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,119
production up and really trying to get

3729
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,800
some results out of it now because at

3730
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,560
this 10 to 20k per month level and now

3731
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:13,840
that you've got your senior AI developer

3732
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,040
and your junior developer and all of

3733
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,480
these things at a fixed cost on your

3734
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,719
payroll each month, you need to be able

3735
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:20,239
to consistently generate leads and you

3736
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:21,679
can't just rely on your warm warm

3737
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:23,280
connections anymore. You need to have a

3738
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,440
system for consistently bringing in new

3739
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:27,360
new business and the content is the best

3740
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:28,960
way to not only attract those but also

3741
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,080
to nurture them and make sure that

3742
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:31,679
they're actually likely to sign with you

3743
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:33,040
and see you as the kind of person that

3744
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:34,800
they want to work with. So scaling that

3745
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,080
content output whether it's YouTube,

3746
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,280
whether it's LinkedIn, whether it's

3747
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,719
Twitter, whether you want to write on

3748
02:00:38,719 --> 02:00:40,320
Medium, just picking something and doing

3749
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:41,679
it really well so that you can start to

3750
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:43,280
generate leads consistently. And the

3751
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:44,800
other half of that content side is

3752
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,560
building an email list for consistent

3753
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,080
lead generation moving forward. So, I've

3754
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:49,520
talked about this before, but part of

3755
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,040
the reason that we've never really had

3756
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,440
to worry about doing at running ads or

3757
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,280
or doing having to shake some extra

3758
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:56,560
trees for leads at Morningside, we've

3759
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:57,920
been booked out basically for two months

3760
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:00,000
ahead for the past year or more. That

3761
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,760
comes down to us capturing thousands and

3762
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,119
thousands of emails of businesses who

3763
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:04,560
want to work with us through our contact

3764
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:06,239
form. Pretty basic way, but we haven't

3765
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:08,480
really had to stress this too much

3766
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:09,920
because we've had so much interest. But

3767
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,040
through all of those emails we've

3768
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,480
collected, when there's ever a need for

3769
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,320
us to bring on more clients, we've got

3770
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:15,840
vacancies available. we'll just send out

3771
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:16,960
an email and say, "Hey, look, we have

3772
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,480
one or two slots available. If you're

3773
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:19,920
interested, please book a call here."

3774
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:21,440
And that's how we've consistently signed

3775
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:23,440
clients and allowed us to support a a

3776
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,880
significant payroll of developers and

3777
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:26,719
and other team members to help us run

3778
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:28,560
the business. So, as you can see here,

3779
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:30,239
the estimated costs have shone up

3780
02:01:30,239 --> 02:01:31,760
because you take on the senior aid and

3781
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:33,280
the junior AI developer, which I'm going

3782
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,400
to be breaking down their recommended

3783
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:35,760
monthly salaries at the end, like I

3784
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,199
mentioned. But this is the phase where

3785
02:01:37,199 --> 02:01:39,360
you do have to eat a lot of cost and the

3786
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:40,639
profit margin is going to drop down

3787
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:43,360
massively. Like you see here 27.5% but

3788
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,560
once you throw on softwares and some

3789
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:45,760
other things it could be even lower than

3790
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:47,760
that. Um so this is really the phase

3791
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:49,199
where you're not taking any money home.

3792
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:50,880
It's going all back in and you were just

3793
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:52,080
trying to grind through this phase and

3794
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:53,599
get that lead generation built up so

3795
02:01:53,599 --> 02:01:54,880
that you're not only making enough money

3796
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,199
to support and pay for these new devs

3797
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:58,480
that you brought on but to actually get

3798
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:00,400
some kind of ROI and allow you to scale

3799
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:02,239
beyond this with that existing team. So

3800
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:03,840
this is really the first foothold in

3801
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:05,040
starting an agency because it's like

3802
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:07,040
okay I actually have my own team now.

3803
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,480
Now I need to crank the lead generation

3804
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,239
so that I can actually support them and

3805
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:12,000
continue to make money moving forward at

3806
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,679
greater profit margins than this in the

3807
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:15,199
later stages. The tech stack for this is

3808
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:16,960
all the same apart from throwing on kit

3809
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,199
which is a email marketing platform um

3810
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:20,239
which you're going to be using to build

3811
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:22,000
your list. You can make lead magnets and

3812
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,440
sort of send traffic to it from your

3813
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,800
content. They can sign up to it, put

3814
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:26,239
them into your email list and then also

3815
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:27,760
send newsletters and broadcast to them.

3816
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,119
So that's your whole email capture and

3817
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:30,719
email marketing platform which I'd

3818
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:32,239
highly recommend to use. And the quote

3819
02:02:32,239 --> 02:02:33,760
for this phase is, "My lead flow is

3820
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:35,119
consistent enough to hire full-time

3821
02:02:35,119 --> 02:02:36,880
developers, but I need to keep pushing

3822
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:38,639
on content and email capture in order to

3823
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:40,080
scale further." Then we're getting into

3824
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,000
stage four, which is scaling from 20 to

3825
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,679
50K per month. So, the main hire for

3826
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:45,360
this phase is going to be a CTO, which

3827
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,280
is like your senior AI developer on

3828
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:49,040
steroids. This is someone who can not

3829
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:50,719
only plan and architect these builds,

3830
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:52,880
but also manage a a larger team

3831
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,320
underneath them, not just a senior and

3832
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:55,760
junior dev in this phase, but also

3833
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:57,199
moving forward. So, it's a very

3834
02:02:57,199 --> 02:02:59,760
forwardthinking uh hire and you need to

3835
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:00,880
make sure that they're a great fit for

3836
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:02,159
you and and they have the capabilities

3837
02:03:02,159 --> 02:03:04,080
to manage a team but also know how to

3838
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,560
architect builds as well. So, the CTO um

3839
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,159
also kind of helps you out on the sales

3840
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:09,840
side. If you are have been taking all of

3841
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:12,000
the sales calls yourself, then the CTO

3842
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,599
can start to hop on these calls for you

3843
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:15,360
either with you on the call as well once

3844
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,199
you I probably recommend you do that for

3845
02:03:17,199 --> 02:03:18,480
a month or two and bring them up to

3846
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:20,080
speed on how to run the sales calls and

3847
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:21,360
then you can start letting the CTO to

3848
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,639
take the calls themselves which is going

3849
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:24,639
to be a huge time unlock for you. So

3850
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:26,400
when you were hiring for that CTO role,

3851
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:27,920
it becomes even more difficult because

3852
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:29,679
not only do they need to know the

3853
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:31,119
technical side, but also need to be able

3854
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:32,719
to talk to clients and be and be client

3855
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:34,400
facing as well and be able to take them

3856
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,760
through that sales process. So very

3857
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:37,840
difficult to find a good one u but well

3858
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,040
worth your while and you're going to see

3859
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:40,800
the compensation estimates in a bit. Um

3860
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,400
but it can be pretty eye watering at

3861
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,320
times. So you've got the CTO and then

3862
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,000
under them is the senior AI dev, the

3863
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,440
junior AI dev, your virtual assistant

3864
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,040
and then your finance as as we had

3865
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,639
before and the CTO is going to be

3866
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:52,239
managing all of those devs. The focus

3867
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:53,679
for this phase is going to be optimizing

3868
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:55,040
the onboarding and service delivery

3869
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:56,320
processes as you're going to be really

3870
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:57,920
taking on a significant volume of

3871
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,599
projects per month. So you need to make

3872
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:01,520
sure that that onboarding process and so

3873
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:03,119
your prompt engineering process and your

3874
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:05,040
review process for your build all of

3875
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:06,320
these things are actually documented

3876
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,599
rather than just doing things by the

3877
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:09,520
seat of your pants. Um in this phase

3878
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:10,719
that's so critical or things are going

3879
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:12,159
to get really messy very quick. And then

3880
02:04:12,159 --> 02:04:14,000
of course in order to get to $50,000 per

3881
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
month your content creation and email

3882
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,280
marketing needs to be consistent as

3883
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,040
well. The quote for this phase is things

3884
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:20,800
are getting chaotic again. I'm out of my

3885
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,480
depth. They need help to bring order and

3886
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:24,159
set up delivery systems so that we can

3887
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:26,159
continue to scale. So this is really a

3888
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:28,719
moment of understanding, hey, I need

3889
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:30,560
help here. I'm like many of you may not

3890
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,000
be coming from technical backgrounds. If

3891
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,520
you are a nontechnical founder coming in

3892
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:35,679
and running a a basically a form of

3893
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:38,320
development company at 30 to $40,000 per

3894
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:39,760
month, you're going to start to see,

3895
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,280
hey, look, I don't really I'm a bit out

3896
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:42,639
of my depth here. I don't know how to

3897
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:44,239
manage so many projects at once. I don't

3898
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:45,440
know how to work with developers and

3899
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,199
manage tickets and stuff like this. And

3900
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:49,599
that's why you bring in a CTO who can do

3901
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:51,360
that managerial side and really bring a

3902
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:54,239
bit of development expertise into the

3903
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:56,400
organization and can set up things like

3904
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,520
you can see on the tech stack here.

3905
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:58,400
There's a whole bunch of different ones

3906
02:04:58,400 --> 02:04:59,679
you can choose from. Jira is the one

3907
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:01,520
that we use at Morningside AI and it's

3908
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:02,639
worked really really well for us. And

3909
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:04,080
when you have a CTO who comes in and

3910
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:06,000
knows how to use Jira for your project

3911
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,280
management and this phase you can see

3912
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,119
that the profit margins are increasing a

3913
02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:10,800
bit again thankfully. Um but you're

3914
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,400
taking on a big cost of that CTO. So

3915
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:13,520
that's eating up a lot of that growth

3916
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:14,880
that you take, but it's much better than

3917
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,159
that establishing phase where you've

3918
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:17,840
taken on so many new people, but your

3919
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:19,119
revenue levels are still pretty low.

3920
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:20,960
Finally, the last phase is expansion,

3921
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,960
and this is from 50 to $100,000 per

3922
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:24,560
month. So the team here is going to be

3923
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:26,880
your CTO. You're going to have a senior

3924
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,400
AI developer as before, but you're going

3925
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:30,159
to have three junior AI developers

3926
02:05:30,159 --> 02:05:32,239
underneath them. So in this case, you

3927
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:34,080
could maybe throw in another senior AI

3928
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,360
developer depending on the kinds of

3929
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,639
projects you're doing or depending on

3930
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:38,480
how good your team is and how well your

3931
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:40,239
CTO is managing things. But basically

3932
02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:41,840
expanding that set of junior developers.

3933
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:43,760
so that your senior and your CTO can be

3934
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:45,040
taking care of a lot of the planning and

3935
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:46,639
and and directing them on what they need

3936
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:48,320
to do and the grunt work is being done

3937
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,000
by the junior AI developer so that you

3938
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,760
don't take on too much cost. I've also

3939
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,360
thrown in here a consultant which I'll

3940
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:54,639
touch on in a second. Then you've got

3941
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:56,800
your virtual assistant, a fractional CFO

3942
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,159
instead of just a bookkeeper. So, he's

3943
02:05:58,159 --> 02:05:59,560
sort of upgrading your finance

3944
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:01,440
capabilities at this phase cuz he's

3945
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:03,040
handling quite a lot of money now. And

3946
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,239
then throwing in to help you on the

3947
02:06:04,239 --> 02:06:06,560
marketing side, a CMO, a chief marketing

3948
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:08,320
officer, and then a copywriter as well

3949
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,080
to help with things like email copy and

3950
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:11,440
also content creation. And we also have

3951
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:13,360
a product/client relations manager in

3952
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:14,960
here as well. And this is what we found

3953
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:16,400
at Morningside to be really necessary

3954
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:17,679
for the bigger projects that you take

3955
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:19,599
on. Having someone who's in charge of

3956
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:20,960
managing the client and being sort of

3957
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,880
the in between the client and the devs

3958
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:24,239
and making sure that everyone's on the

3959
02:06:24,239 --> 02:06:25,599
same page and putting someone

3960
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:27,199
responsible of you are responsible for

3961
02:06:27,199 --> 02:06:29,040
this particular project going ahead has

3962
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:30,639
been super helpful for us. So having a

3963
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:32,560
product owner/client relations manager

3964
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,320
has been a really key role for us in

3965
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:35,679
allowing us to scale further. The

3966
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,119
focuses for this phase are going to be

3967
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:38,960
hiring and training processes. as you're

3968
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,560
bringing in so many of these junior AI

3969
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:41,920
developers, um you need to make sure

3970
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,119
that they are being onboarded and

3971
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:44,960
trained right for working in your

3972
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,239
organization. This is how you're

3973
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:47,599
supposed to do prompt engineering within

3974
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:49,360
our organization. This is how we do

3975
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,880
reviews and all of these things need to

3976
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,400
be streamlined and and clearly

3977
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:54,159
documented so that you can onboard new

3978
02:06:54,159 --> 02:06:56,239
devs without this really clunky like 2

3979
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:58,320
month period of just them bashing into

3980
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:59,840
stuff until they finally learn how it

3981
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,599
actually works. So documenting it and

3982
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:03,440
working on those training processes as

3983
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:05,280
soon as those new hires come in and then

3984
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,960
also diversifying your offering away

3985
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,719
from strictly implementation to things

3986
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:10,719
like AI consulting or AI education. And

3987
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:12,079
when it comes to this diversifying of

3988
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:13,360
your offering away from strictly

3989
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,199
development, uh the quote here breaks it

3990
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:16,719
down. So we've built a capable

3991
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:18,159
development shop. So we've got a really

3992
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:19,679
good development shop on our hands.

3993
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:21,040
We've got a great team. We are able to

3994
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,040
deliver quality projects. Now it's time

3995
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,280
to diversify our income and build a

3996
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:26,480
support team for me on the marketing

3997
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:28,000
side. Basically, we have the AI

3998
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,520
expertise now. we've proven that we know

3999
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:31,199
how to do this. We've helped so many of

4000
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:32,880
our clients do the same. Now you can

4001
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,040
start to like break that that knowledge

4002
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:37,280
and expertise into other services. Okay,

4003
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:38,800
we can help you with consulting and

4004
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,719
identifying what best use cases can be

4005
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:42,400
used within your business or we can make

4006
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,239
an AI education package to help your

4007
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:45,920
organization understand this technology

4008
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,360
as a whole and you can start to sell

4009
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,639
different services to different

4010
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:50,320
segments, not necessarily just those

4011
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:51,840
businesses who are ready for AI

4012
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:53,440
implementation within their business. So

4013
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:54,880
that's what the consultant represents in

4014
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,800
that team. it's expanding outside of

4015
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:00,000
implementation to say a3 or $5,000 of a

4016
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,840
of a consulting package. Or you might

4017
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,199
put together some kind of workshop and

4018
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:05,040
the consultant hops on and and educates

4019
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:06,800
a business for a few thousand for a

4020
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,560
2-hour workshop. There's these kind of

4021
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,840
options that open up now that you

4022
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,520
actually have the credibility of we

4023
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,520
build AI stuff for businesses. We know

4024
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:14,880
what we're talking about. That's why you

4025
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,000
don't start with education and

4026
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,760
consulting immediately. You do need to

4027
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:19,280
kind of learn the ropes and figure out

4028
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:20,639
what actually works so you can go back

4029
02:08:20,639 --> 02:08:22,400
and sell those services with some kind

4030
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:24,560
of credibility. You can get away with it

4031
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,639
just immediately, but the credibility

4032
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:28,400
really comes from we have this this

4033
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:30,400
we've done. This is why we can tell you

4034
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,760
or direct your business on how to

4035
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:33,520
implement on your AI strategy moving

4036
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,119
forward. And so finally, as promised,

4037
02:08:35,119 --> 02:08:37,760
the compensation estimates are here. Um

4038
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:39,119
these are just the starting monthly

4039
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:41,280
cost. You will likely get people asking

4040
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:42,880
for pay rises or they're performing

4041
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:44,000
really well. So you want to increase

4042
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
their pay, but this is roughly the the

4043
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,679
starting monthly costs or or starting

4044
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:48,800
fees that you're going to have for these

4045
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,560
different staff members. So, the revenue

4046
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:52,000
share developer, you can start off at

4047
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,079
20% or 30% depending on how the

4048
02:08:54,079 --> 02:08:56,239
negotiation goes. Um, so that's for the

4049
02:08:56,239 --> 02:08:57,520
early stages where you're taking on,

4050
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:00,079
hey, I have a $3,000 project. If you

4051
02:09:00,079 --> 02:09:01,440
want to build it for me, we can do a rev

4052
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,520
share. You get 30%. Even again, it

4053
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:04,880
depends on the on the person you're

4054
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,079
working with. But if you can get around

4055
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:08,000
that 20 to 30%, that's ideal. Then your

4056
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,280
virtual assistant, you can expect to pay

4057
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:10,800
about $1,000 a month for that. If

4058
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,239
they're working around the clock, you

4059
02:09:12,239 --> 02:09:13,599
might not have that much work for them.

4060
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:14,880
So, it might be less, but if you're

4061
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,000
talking about a full-time virtual

4062
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,440
assistant, that's about how much you're

4063
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:19,440
going to be paying. Your senior AI devs

4064
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,440
will start at $8,000. Your junior AI

4065
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:22,960
devs will start at $5,000. Your

4066
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,560
bookkeeper and finance will start at

4067
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,560
$500 to $1,000 a month depending on the

4068
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,320
level of services that you need. Then

4069
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,639
your CTO comes in at a whopping $12,000

4070
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:32,079
per month, which is why we wait a little

4071
02:09:32,079 --> 02:09:34,400
bit longer to get them involved. The CMO

4072
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,159
can be around $6,000 a month. Your

4073
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:37,679
copywriter can be three. Then you have

4074
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:38,800
your product and client relations

4075
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,639
manager, which can cost around $5,000 a

4076
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:41,920
month as well. So again, these are

4077
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:43,280
starting prices. you may be able to find

4078
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:44,400
cheaper elsewhere, but these are just

4079
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,520
the costs that we've encountered at

4080
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:47,199
Morningside AI in order to get good

4081
02:09:47,199 --> 02:09:49,360
talent at these different levels of uh

4082
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:50,960
levels of seniority and across all of

4083
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:52,480
these different roles in general. So,

4084
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:53,920
hope that's been helpful. Um, I tried to

4085
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,440
bake in as much of my experience over

4086
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,119
the past nearly 2 years of building

4087
02:09:57,119 --> 02:09:58,880
these businesses um into that. I really

4088
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:00,159
hope that that's demystified a lot of

4089
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:01,360
these different things like what should

4090
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:02,719
I be focusing on and when. I will be

4091
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:04,239
putting the slideshow on my free school

4092
02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:05,440
community. There's a little post you can

4093
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,440
find in the YouTube resources. This

4094
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,639
entire slideshow will be on there for

4095
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:09,840
you guys to take if you want. But yeah,

4096
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:13,360
that's all for the video.

4097
02:10:14,159 --> 02:10:15,599
Today I've got a quick video breaking

4098
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:17,599
down general versus niched AI automation

4099
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:19,360
agencies, the two different methods or

4100
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,280
main methods in the market right now and

4101
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:22,880
why choosing wrong could be the biggest

4102
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:24,560
mistake you make in your journey. So

4103
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:26,000
it's so vital that you pick the right

4104
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,360
one and in this video I want to break it

4105
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:28,560
down and give you a step-by-step

4106
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:30,239
strategy. So here's the key takeaways.

4107
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:31,440
Understand the key difference between

4108
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:33,760
niched and general AAA's. Uh knowing the

4109
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:35,599
pros and cons of each of the models, uh

4110
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:37,280
deciding which one of these is best for

4111
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:38,960
your unique situation. And finally, I'll

4112
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:40,480
be ending the video with a six-step

4113
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,639
action plan to start your own, depending

4114
02:10:42,639 --> 02:10:44,239
on which one is right for you. So, if by

4115
02:10:44,239 --> 02:10:45,440
the end of the video, it's clear that a

4116
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:46,800
niche agency is right for you, you'll

4117
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,639
get a six-step plan to start one. And if

4118
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:50,079
by the end of the video, a general one

4119
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:51,119
is clearly right for you, you're going

4120
02:10:51,119 --> 02:10:53,119
to get a six-step process to start your

4121
02:10:53,119 --> 02:10:54,480
own general agency. So, let's get into

4122
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,079
it. And for full transparency, because I

4123
02:10:56,079 --> 02:10:57,280
know YouTube could do with a lot more of

4124
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:59,119
that. Um, I make these videos so that I

4125
02:10:59,119 --> 02:11:00,800
can educate you to start your own AI

4126
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,560
agency and and successfully run one so

4127
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:04,079
that you can become a potential customer

4128
02:11:04,079 --> 02:11:05,440
for the software that I make for

4129
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:07,360
successful AI agency owners. So the more

4130
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:08,880
money you make with AI automation agency

4131
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:10,400
and the one that you start, the more

4132
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,000
customers I have my SAS and the more I

4133
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,119
can potentially sell my SAS for

4134
02:11:13,119 --> 02:11:15,599
eventually. So um if if you don't win, I

4135
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:17,360
don't win. And that's why we're kind of

4136
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:18,880
in this thing together. So So let's do

4137
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:21,280
this. General first niche agencies.

4138
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:22,880
First example we can look at is in

4139
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:24,320
nature. So in nature there are

4140
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:26,560
ecological niches. All organisms adapt

4141
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:27,920
through natural selection if that's what

4142
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:29,840
you choose to believe. But they adapt to

4143
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:31,599
fulfill different ecological niches. And

4144
02:11:31,599 --> 02:11:33,040
we have either specialists or

4145
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:34,239
generalists. In this case here, you can

4146
02:11:34,239 --> 02:11:36,000
see a koala and a panda. They are

4147
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,840
specialists. They have a narrow niche.

4148
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:39,520
Uh they're less adaptable because they

4149
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,199
have specialized needs. They are more

4150
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:42,800
likely to become extinct because they're

4151
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:45,119
less adaptable to change. Um they use a

4152
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:46,800
specific set of resources. I think

4153
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,719
koalas just eat eucalyptus leaves of

4154
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:50,800
eucalyptus trees all the time. Um so you

4155
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:52,320
get the idea. Specialists are very

4156
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,000
narrow. They they occupy one little area

4157
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,079
of the wider ecosystem, but they do it

4158
02:11:56,079 --> 02:11:58,239
well and they escape competition by uh

4159
02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:00,000
succeeding within the small niche. And

4160
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,440
then we have generalists who have a

4161
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:03,280
broad niche. They are adaptable to many

4162
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:05,040
environments, therefore less likely to

4163
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:06,800
become extinct, and they use a variety

4164
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,040
of resources to to survive, right? Um,

4165
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,480
so these are the two different types.

4166
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:12,639
And you can see obviously we've got rats

4167
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:14,239
and raccoons as being generalist, and

4168
02:12:14,239 --> 02:12:15,280
they're much more hearty. I mean,

4169
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:16,560
alligators and stuff like this that have

4170
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:19,040
been around basically unchanged for for

4171
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:20,480
millions of years. Then we have

4172
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:21,760
specialists on the other side. And the

4173
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:22,880
specialists are typically where the

4174
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,480
majestic and interesting animals are,

4175
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:26,400
while generalists are sort of functional

4176
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:27,760
and they don't have too many frills. So

4177
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:28,960
we can learn a lot from nature and how

4178
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,480
these different organisms adapt and the

4179
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:32,320
benefits and drawbacks of being

4180
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:33,599
specialists or generalists as you're

4181
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:34,800
going to see reappear throughout this

4182
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,800
presentation. So firstly we have general

4183
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,639
agencies in the in the AI automation

4184
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:40,320
agency space. An example of this is my

4185
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:42,239
own agency morning site AI which is

4186
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:44,079
basically a if you want it we can build

4187
02:12:44,079 --> 02:12:45,599
it. So we have the capabilities in the

4188
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:47,360
team to basically deliver anything as

4189
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:48,400
long as it's within the realm of

4190
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:50,639
possibility right so this consists of a

4191
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:52,320
team of AI developers. We've got some

4192
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,760
low code specialists as well that are a

4193
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:54,880
little bit cheaper. If you haven't seen

4194
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,480
my hiring video I'd check it out up

4195
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:57,520
here. That's a very important one that I

4196
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:59,119
posted last week. And we have some front

4197
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:00,239
end devs as well. So, you're not always

4198
02:13:00,239 --> 02:13:01,280
going to have front end devs, but

4199
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:02,800
because we do some some full platform

4200
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:04,320
buildouts at Morningside, we also have

4201
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:05,679
front end devs on hand, too. And the

4202
02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:07,360
usual sales process for general agencies

4203
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:09,280
is a discovery call, then going to scope

4204
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:11,119
it, you do a proposal, and you sign a

4205
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:12,480
deal. So, it's very much what do you

4206
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,760
need? Let's figure it out. Let's get on

4207
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:14,880
the same page. Okay, this is how much

4208
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,320
it's going to cost. Great. Let's get

4209
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:17,920
going. And so, the pros and cons of the

4210
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:19,920
general agency model. Uh the pros are

4211
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:21,599
firstly that you don't need an offer and

4212
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:23,280
that if you set your agency upright and

4213
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:24,880
your lead generation systems are solid,

4214
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:26,880
people will be coming to you and telling

4215
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:28,560
you what they want. So because you don't

4216
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:29,760
need an offer and you don't need to

4217
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,520
identify what these people need and and

4218
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,960
sell it to them. They're going to come

4219
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:34,560
and tell you what they want. So it's a

4220
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:36,079
lot easier to start. You can say we have

4221
02:13:36,079 --> 02:13:38,320
the team, you have the problem, let us

4222
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:39,280
know what you want and we'll try to

4223
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:40,880
build it for you. So easier to start

4224
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:42,159
because you don't need to do market

4225
02:13:42,159 --> 02:13:43,360
research and come up with an offer.

4226
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:45,040
Secondly, we have a larger TAM or total

4227
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:46,639
addressable market. I put asterisk on

4228
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:48,079
the TAM because I think it's a bit silly

4229
02:13:48,079 --> 02:13:49,599
to be talking about, oh, but my market

4230
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:51,360
is bigger than yours cuz I mean it's

4231
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:52,960
we're so new to it that there's very few

4232
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:54,079
service providers in these different

4233
02:13:54,079 --> 02:13:56,320
niches. So, that's not a major, but

4234
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,679
essentially you have a larger pool of

4235
02:13:57,679 --> 02:14:00,239
people that you can sell to. Thirdly, as

4236
02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:01,920
a general agency, you get to taste a lot

4237
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,360
of different niches. Um, because you're

4238
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:04,960
working with anyone who comes to you,

4239
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,800
you get to see how AI can be applied in

4240
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:07,920
different industries, which can be very

4241
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:09,760
helpful for you as the agency owner to

4242
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,520
build up a better mental model and

4243
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:12,880
understanding of how AI can help

4244
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,400
businesses. So at Morningside, I've

4245
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:15,440
learned so much from seeing the

4246
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:16,800
different businesses that we work with.

4247
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,480
And it helps me to communicate a lot of

4248
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,400
the stuff to you, which is why I why why

4249
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:21,760
I know so much. Basically, number four

4250
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:23,280
is that as a general agency, you're more

4251
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:24,960
nimble and adaptable by not being

4252
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,639
specifically focused on one niche or one

4253
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:28,320
offer. You're able to change and update

4254
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,840
whenever you need to. So when OpenAI

4255
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:31,040
drops an update, you can go back to

4256
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:32,880
clients and say, "Hey, look, GPT5's come

4257
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:34,239
out. Do you want this? Oh, there's this

4258
02:14:34,239 --> 02:14:35,520
new product coming out from Google.

4259
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,480
Okay, do you want this?" You're very

4260
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:38,159
nimble and adaptable. Or you can start

4261
02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:39,679
offering consulting and you can pivot in

4262
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:40,800
any direction you want. And that's

4263
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:42,480
that's the last point here which is you

4264
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:44,000
can always niche down later. So if you

4265
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,840
unnimble your you do see a good

4266
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,520
opportunity then you can narrow down

4267
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:49,520
your agency to a specific area which is

4268
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:50,880
what I recommend you guys doing if you

4269
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,639
start an agency like a general one. Then

4270
02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:54,159
we have the cons of the general agency.

4271
02:14:54,159 --> 02:14:55,760
Firstly because you're a general agency

4272
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:57,280
you're not seen as a specialist and

4273
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,960
therefore the value of your services is

4274
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,480
perceived as lower by the people that

4275
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:01,679
you're going to be selling to which can

4276
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:04,159
be an issue if you were AI. I mean

4277
02:15:04,159 --> 02:15:05,840
hypothetically if you had an e-commerce

4278
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:07,280
customer and you had two agencies

4279
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,800
competing for it. one was a specialized

4280
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,960
e-commerce AI agency and one was just a

4281
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:13,199
general agency. Um, which one would you

4282
02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:14,159
choose? Right? So, that's that's the

4283
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:15,679
basic concept of not being seen as a

4284
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:17,520
specialist. Secondly, you have lower

4285
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:19,360
reusability and therefore lower profits.

4286
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:20,960
So, this goes back to what I covered in

4287
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:22,560
my my hiring video as well that I

4288
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,079
recommend you go watch. But, when you

4289
02:15:24,079 --> 02:15:26,079
are selling uh as a general agency,

4290
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:27,520
you're likely going to be taking clients

4291
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:29,040
from all different industries. Every

4292
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:30,400
single time someone comes in, it's going

4293
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,840
to be new and you need to plan it and

4294
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:33,360
build it from scratch. So, there's less

4295
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,040
reusability between clients. But if

4296
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:36,239
you're doing a niche agency, as you're

4297
02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:38,400
going to see in a second, you can sell

4298
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:39,679
basically the same thing over and over

4299
02:15:39,679 --> 02:15:41,119
and over again just with minor tweaks

4300
02:15:41,119 --> 02:15:43,040
between them. So less reusability.

4301
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:44,159
You're building it from scratch every

4302
02:15:44,159 --> 02:15:45,440
time. Therefore means there's lower

4303
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:46,800
profits because there's more time and

4304
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:49,040
manh hours being put into uh every

4305
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:50,800
single one of those projects on in

4306
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,159
general. You know, you can you can tweak

4307
02:15:52,159 --> 02:15:54,000
around the margins, etc. But as a

4308
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,199
general rule of thumb, it's going to be

4309
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:56,719
lower profits. Thirdly, as a general

4310
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:58,000
agency, you're likely not going to have

4311
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,320
any offers and say we build X for Y

4312
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:02,159
amount of money. You can I've seen some

4313
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:03,280
people experiment with it, but I haven't

4314
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:05,040
done it myself. Uh but it's harder to

4315
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:06,239
market yourself when you don't have an

4316
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:07,679
offer. You don't know who you're

4317
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:08,880
supposed to reach out to and you can't

4318
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:11,040
really angle it and say we make X for Y

4319
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:13,119
businesses by doing Z. So it makes it a

4320
02:16:13,119 --> 02:16:14,159
little bit harder to market your

4321
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:15,920
services. Now fourth, we have a higher

4322
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:17,679
complexity and therefore a higher issue

4323
02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:19,520
rate. So if you're building customcoded

4324
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:21,040
stuff from scratch every time or you're

4325
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:22,480
building not necessarily custom coded,

4326
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:23,760
but if you're building custom projects

4327
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,520
from scratch every time um to the

4328
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,880
client's needs, you're therefore going

4329
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,239
to have a higher issue rate. you're

4330
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:29,520
going to have more problems that come up

4331
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:30,960
because when you're reinventing the

4332
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,318
wheel every time and and coming up with

4333
02:16:32,318 --> 02:16:33,760
a new solution, you're to some degree

4334
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,760
testing and and and making a hypothesis

4335
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:37,599
and and seeing if that's right. And when

4336
02:16:37,599 --> 02:16:39,359
it's wrong, you have to go back and and

4337
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:41,040
continue to to work on the project and

4338
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,879
bring more developers in, etc. So, a

4339
02:16:42,879 --> 02:16:44,638
higher issue or problem rate typically

4340
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:46,558
results in lower client satisfaction and

4341
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:48,240
also lower profits because you're

4342
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:49,760
tending to spend more time going back

4343
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:51,200
and and paying your developers to work

4344
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,638
on the same problem that you've already

4345
02:16:52,638 --> 02:16:53,760
solved. So, it's it's it's highly

4346
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,359
inefficient if you don't have the right

4347
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:56,799
talent. Number five one here is less

4348
02:16:56,799 --> 02:16:58,240
compounded credibility. And this comes

4349
02:16:58,240 --> 02:16:59,920
from by doing projects in a bunch of

4350
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:00,879
different niches and you're not

4351
02:17:00,879 --> 02:17:02,638
consistently delivering one or or

4352
02:17:02,638 --> 02:17:04,318
building up some kind of track record.

4353
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:05,760
When you go to pitch another client and

4354
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:06,799
they say, "What have you done?" Well,

4355
02:17:06,799 --> 02:17:08,398
I've done 10 other projects in

4356
02:17:08,398 --> 02:17:09,920
completely different industries, your

4357
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:12,000
perceived expertise is lower and

4358
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,840
therefore your it's going to be harder

4359
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,599
to close those deals and you can charge

4360
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:17,439
you won't be able to charge as much. So,

4361
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:18,478
um, as you'll see with the niche

4362
02:17:18,478 --> 02:17:20,160
example, it's a lot different there, but

4363
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:21,760
you have less compounding credibility

4364
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:23,120
because all your projects spread out

4365
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:24,478
across different industries. Next point

4366
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:25,519
here is that you're going to need more

4367
02:17:25,519 --> 02:17:27,120
expensive devs. This is because if

4368
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,558
you're building on request and you're

4369
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:29,760
building custom solutions for your

4370
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:31,519
clients each time. Um then you're going

4371
02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:33,679
to need to hire people who are smarter

4372
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:35,120
or have more experience and are better

4373
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:37,040
able to solve problems and architect

4374
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,318
solutions as well. So you're naturally

4375
02:17:38,318 --> 02:17:39,920
going to be spending more to get

4376
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:41,280
developers who are capable enough to

4377
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:42,478
come up with these custom solutions

4378
02:17:42,478 --> 02:17:43,840
every time. And finally, there's

4379
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,120
actually less bang for your buck for

4380
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:46,558
your clients when you are doing custom

4381
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:47,920
development solutions. A good example of

4382
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:49,519
this is a student of mine, Isaiah, who's

4383
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:51,040
built an AI appointment setting system

4384
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:53,439
for Instagram DMs for coaches. And I

4385
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:54,959
believe it's a $5,000 package at the

4386
02:17:54,959 --> 02:17:56,478
moment with some usage attached to it.

4387
02:17:56,478 --> 02:17:58,240
He can sell that to his his clients for

4388
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:00,318
$5,000 plus usage, right? Um because

4389
02:18:00,318 --> 02:18:01,439
he's put in all the work and he's built

4390
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:03,200
the product and it now has a thing that

4391
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:05,040
he can just reuse and and resell. So he

4392
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:06,718
can sell it for $5,000 because he knows

4393
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:07,840
he's going to be able to sell multiple

4394
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:09,439
of it. But if that same client came to

4395
02:18:09,439 --> 02:18:11,280
me and my team at Morningside and we do

4396
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:13,280
everything custom and from scratch, when

4397
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:14,799
they come to us, I'd need to charge him

4398
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:17,280
$30,000, $50,000, $60,000 just to try

4399
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,959
and rebuild what Isaiah and his team as

4400
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:20,478
a niche agency have done. So the client

4401
02:18:20,478 --> 02:18:21,760
is technically getting less bang for

4402
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:22,879
their buck. they're having to pay more

4403
02:18:22,879 --> 02:18:24,799
to get the same thing if you are always

4404
02:18:24,799 --> 02:18:26,718
doing custom projects as a as a general

4405
02:18:26,718 --> 02:18:28,558
agency. So next we have niche agencies

4406
02:18:28,558 --> 02:18:30,160
which is basically you have a problem

4407
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:32,318
and I've built the solution. Um you have

4408
02:18:32,318 --> 02:18:34,000
a single product or even a suite of

4409
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,599
products that address some problems

4410
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:37,439
within a given niche or market and for

4411
02:18:37,439 --> 02:18:38,959
your team you need to have some kind of

4412
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:40,959
product lead or or lead developer who's

4413
02:18:40,959 --> 02:18:42,160
leading the development of the product

4414
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,318
and improvement and a team of deliverers

4415
02:18:44,318 --> 02:18:46,000
potentially. So you can have a guy who's

4416
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,679
okay this is our product this is what we

4417
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:48,718
need to do. these are the new features

4418
02:18:48,718 --> 02:18:50,080
we need to add and they can build build

4419
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:51,519
build but then whenever a new client

4420
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:52,959
comes in and says hey I want to buy your

4421
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:54,959
niche solution you just have some junior

4422
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:56,799
developers who your lead developer or

4423
02:18:56,799 --> 02:18:58,638
product lead can actually pass the the

4424
02:18:58,638 --> 02:19:00,638
the template to one of your junior

4425
02:19:00,638 --> 02:19:01,840
developers and they can go in and

4426
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:02,959
deliver it for the clients. So you've

4427
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:04,240
got the brains and you've got some

4428
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:05,359
junior developers who can actually do

4429
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:07,280
the the grunt work of delivering it to

4430
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:08,478
the different clients as you on board

4431
02:19:08,478 --> 02:19:10,240
them. So, as I said, my student Isaiah

4432
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:11,760
has this AI appointment setting system

4433
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:14,080
for Instagram DMs for for coaches. And

4434
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:15,439
this is his website here. And they

4435
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:17,280
clearly specialize in chat bots. In this

4436
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:18,799
case, AI appointment setting systems for

4437
02:19:18,799 --> 02:19:21,280
their businesses. So, jumping into the

4438
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:22,959
pros and cons and the pros of the niche

4439
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:25,439
agency are naturally the inverse of the

4440
02:19:25,439 --> 02:19:27,439
general agency. So, you are seen as a

4441
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:29,439
specialist. You have higher reusability

4442
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:31,280
and therefore higher profit. you have a

4443
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:32,959
clear offer, so it's easier to market

4444
02:19:32,959 --> 02:19:34,959
yourself and really laser target the

4445
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:36,080
people that you're trying to contact and

4446
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,519
and say things that connect with them

4447
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:39,439
and and make them want to purchase. And

4448
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:41,359
fourth, you have a lower complexity when

4449
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:42,959
you're doing the delivery and therefore

4450
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:44,318
a lower issue rate because these

4451
02:19:44,318 --> 02:19:45,760
delivery junior developers are just

4452
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:47,439
going to be taking the the system or the

4453
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:48,960
template that you provided and they can

4454
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:50,319
just copy and paste it across different

4455
02:19:50,319 --> 02:19:51,680
people and tweak it based on the

4456
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,120
client's needs. Um, therefore, you have

4457
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:54,399
a lower issue rate because you're not

4458
02:19:54,399 --> 02:19:55,680
building it from scratch every time. And

4459
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:57,040
I have asterisks here just to point out

4460
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:58,960
that the lower complexity is only after

4461
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:01,439
you've built that first version or or a

4462
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:03,120
satisfactory version of the product and

4463
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:04,800
then it's relatively easy to to

4464
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:06,720
distribute that out. But the building of

4465
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:08,319
of a solid product that provides real

4466
02:20:08,319 --> 02:20:10,319
value is is very difficult as you can

4467
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:12,560
see on the con side. So um fifth point

4468
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:14,000
here is that you get more compounding

4469
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,600
credibility. You're selling the same

4470
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:16,640
thing over and over and you can say

4471
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:18,479
we've helped 20 businesses just like you

4472
02:20:18,479 --> 02:20:20,880
to achieve XYZ and you get real data

4473
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:22,240
points and suddenly you're making much

4474
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:24,640
more compelling offers. And finally, uh,

4475
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:26,399
you get to use less expensive devs for

4476
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:27,760
those deliverers. You know, once you're

4477
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:29,359
actually distributing it and and putting

4478
02:20:29,359 --> 02:20:31,040
it onto clients businesses, you can use

4479
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:32,479
less expensive devs that don't need to

4480
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:33,680
reinvent the wheel every time. Jumping

4481
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:34,960
into the cons, these again are kind of

4482
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:36,560
the inverse of the the pros of the

4483
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:38,240
general model. Um, and that you first

4484
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:39,920
need to solve a real problem. Um,

4485
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:41,200
therefore, it is harder to start. You

4486
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,640
need to identify, do some market

4487
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:44,800
research or understand a niche yourself,

4488
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,080
be able to identify something, say,

4489
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:47,760
there is a problem in the industry. I

4490
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:49,439
think I can solve it with AI and then

4491
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:50,720
you need to actually build the solution.

4492
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,160
So, it's it's a lot harder to start

4493
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:53,760
because you might spend 3 months

4494
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:54,960
thinking you're solving a problem and

4495
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:56,160
getting to the end and realizing no one

4496
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:57,280
wants it, which is really the risk with

4497
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:59,200
the general agency. Um, secondly, you

4498
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:00,960
have a smaller total addressable market

4499
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:02,960
again with an asterisk um because you're

4500
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:04,399
narrowing down to serving only a certain

4501
02:21:04,399 --> 02:21:06,319
set of people. You're less nimble and

4502
02:21:06,319 --> 02:21:08,160
adaptable. So, if OpenAI drops a big

4503
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:09,840
update and just wipes you out if you're

4504
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:11,760
not careful, that's a real risk for

4505
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:13,840
running a niche agency and something you

4506
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:15,840
need to to factor into your decision to

4507
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:17,359
go into one. Fourth point here is that

4508
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:19,600
it's hard to generalize and step back

4509
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:21,600
once you've niched down. So say I I say

4510
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:24,720
I build um automation systems for XYZ

4511
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:26,640
niche that solve XYZ problem and and

4512
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:28,399
I've based my whole agency and my whole

4513
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:30,319
brand around we do this very specific

4514
02:21:30,319 --> 02:21:31,760
thing. It's hard if you bought the

4515
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:33,439
domain and made the website and and

4516
02:21:33,439 --> 02:21:34,399
talked to a whole bunch of people and

4517
02:21:34,399 --> 02:21:35,520
made a whole bunch of posts on your

4518
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:37,439
YouTube channel. It's hard to generalize

4519
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:39,439
and roll back after that if you've

4520
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:40,720
already niched down. So that's one of

4521
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:42,160
the cons is that it's it's really hard

4522
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:44,000
to go it's easy to go down. It's hard to

4523
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,080
go back. And finally, creating a good

4524
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:48,000
product that actually solves a problem

4525
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,760
and that people want to that climbing

4526
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:51,760
overhand and fist to get access to is

4527
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:53,520
hard. Finding product market fit is

4528
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:55,040
hard, but once you can achieve it and

4529
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:56,240
once you get there, it is worthwhile.

4530
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:58,000
And so with these in mind, which one is

4531
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,600
best for you and your unique situation?

4532
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:02,160
So, uh, for general agencies, if you

4533
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:04,080
don't have any clear experience in in a

4534
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:06,240
niche, say you haven't worked in in the

4535
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:08,000
accounting space or the financial

4536
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,760
services industry for 10, 20 years, and

4537
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:12,000
you don't really understand a niche

4538
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,439
inside out, you haven't maybe run a

4539
02:22:13,439 --> 02:22:14,640
business in the space before and

4540
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,560
understand, I mean, I had a landscaping

4541
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:17,760
business. I know that that's a really

4542
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:19,120
good problem and I I could very easily

4543
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:20,800
go in and solve it. If you don't have

4544
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:22,399
clear experience that's giving you ideas

4545
02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:24,319
for problems to solve, um, then a

4546
02:22:24,319 --> 02:22:25,520
general agency is probably the best

4547
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:26,640
option. And secondly, if you don't have

4548
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:28,000
a bunch of connections that can allow

4549
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,760
you to start having conversations with

4550
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:31,439
business owners in a certain area that

4551
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:32,960
can give you insights on what problems

4552
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,640
they're trying to solve um or have

4553
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:36,160
connections that you can sell to or use

4554
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:37,680
as a referral partners to distribute

4555
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:39,120
your solutions later on once it's done.

4556
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,560
So if you don't have experience, you

4557
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,080
don't have clear connections, then a

4558
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:43,359
general agency is probably the best

4559
02:22:43,359 --> 02:22:44,800
route for you. And starting a general

4560
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:46,399
agency doesn't require a ton of upfront

4561
02:22:46,399 --> 02:22:47,840
capital. I didn't have to invest a huge

4562
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:49,120
amount of money into Morningside to get

4563
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:50,240
it off the ground. I just started making

4564
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:51,840
my YouTube videos and we were off to the

4565
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:53,359
races once the leads started coming in.

4566
02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:54,720
And if you are new to business, a

4567
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:56,319
general agency can be a better starting

4568
02:22:56,319 --> 02:22:57,680
point for people getting into

4569
02:22:57,680 --> 02:22:59,040
entrepreneurship as well. It allows you

4570
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:00,800
to learn the skills more slowly and

4571
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:02,160
gradually than to throw yourself head

4572
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:04,160
first into a niche agency. Now, for a

4573
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:05,760
niche agency, uh if you have the

4574
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,439
industry experience, like I said, you

4575
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:08,720
know the pain points of a given industry

4576
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:09,760
and you can go straight in there and

4577
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:11,120
say, "I'm going to solve this problem."

4578
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:12,640
If you have a strong pool of connections

4579
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,080
that you can start using to distribute

4580
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:15,840
this solution once it's done, that's

4581
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:17,760
great. If you do have some capital on

4582
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,120
hand or you have some money that you can

4583
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:20,880
invest into building a solution, you

4584
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:22,240
might need to go to a developer or a

4585
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:23,760
development team and say, "I know what I

4586
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:25,520
need. Here's the money. Build it and

4587
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:27,040
then I can go and sell it." So that's in

4588
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:28,560
the case where some capital will be very

4589
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:30,000
helpful for you in starting your niche

4590
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,520
agency. And finally, being experienced

4591
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:32,960
in business can be very helpful when

4592
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:34,160
you're starting a niche agency because

4593
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:36,399
you you understand how a business works

4594
02:23:36,399 --> 02:23:37,760
overall. Okay, there's sales teams,

4595
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:38,880
there's lead generation, there's this,

4596
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:40,960
this when you understand end to end how

4597
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:42,479
businesses work, it's much clearer and

4598
02:23:42,479 --> 02:23:44,560
it's much easier to identify where you

4599
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:46,240
can provide value. So just pause the

4600
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:48,319
video now have a think is based on these

4601
02:23:48,319 --> 02:23:50,240
criteria on screen is a general one best

4602
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:51,840
for me or is a niche agency best for me

4603
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:53,040
and the way I've formatted this should

4604
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:54,640
help. If it's bolded you have to have

4605
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:56,000
it. So if you're going to choose niche

4606
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,520
you have to have the industry experience

4607
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:58,640
you have to have a strong pool of

4608
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:00,240
connections but these are are nice to

4609
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:01,120
have haves but if you're looking at

4610
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:02,399
being a general agency owner you

4611
02:24:02,399 --> 02:24:03,920
shouldn't have any significant

4612
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,040
experience and you shouldn't have any

4613
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:06,240
significant connections in which case

4614
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:07,920
you would have been over there. So make

4615
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:09,280
sure that you stick to the way that I

4616
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:10,399
formatted these cuz these are nice to

4617
02:24:10,399 --> 02:24:11,920
haves. These are must haves. So now that

4618
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:13,200
you know which type of agency is best

4619
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:14,880
for you, you need this sixstep strategy

4620
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:16,000
on how to start. So with general

4621
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,080
agencies, this is the fastest route to

4622
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:19,520
start and and get up and running that I

4623
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:21,359
would recommend. Firstly, start a

4624
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:22,880
personal brand as I have done here on

4625
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:24,160
YouTube. Whether that's LinkedIn,

4626
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:27,040
YouTube, u Medium or Twitter, whatever

4627
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:28,319
you want to choose, just pick one and do

4628
02:24:28,319 --> 02:24:29,600
it well. Secondly, you need to start

4629
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:31,439
tinkering with AI solutions and learn

4630
02:24:31,439 --> 02:24:32,720
the platforms that I talk about here on

4631
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:33,760
the channel. So you need to at least

4632
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:35,359
become familiar with the tools that we

4633
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:37,120
use to deliver the solutions and get an

4634
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:38,640
idea of, okay, this is the value that I

4635
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:39,840
can start to create. So at least a

4636
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:41,359
fundamental understanding can be gained

4637
02:24:41,359 --> 02:24:42,800
from tinkering around and watching my

4638
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:44,160
tutorials. Thirdly, you need to start

4639
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:45,840
sharing your builds and your learnings

4640
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:47,439
on your personal brand platform, whether

4641
02:24:47,439 --> 02:24:49,120
that's LinkedIn or YouTube, etc. This is

4642
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:50,800
going to start to build your authority

4643
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:52,160
and also lead to growth on these

4644
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:53,280
platforms as well. This is what I've

4645
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:54,479
done on YouTube. You can scroll back and

4646
02:24:54,479 --> 02:24:55,840
see my entire history of doing this on

4647
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:58,319
this channel. So fourth, uh you need to

4648
02:24:58,319 --> 02:24:59,840
offer free consulting calls that can

4649
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:01,920
help businesses with AI. And this can be

4650
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:03,359
done through posting, say on LinkedIn,

4651
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:04,640
you're making posts and saying, "Hey, if

4652
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:06,160
you're interested, you can book a

4653
02:25:06,160 --> 02:25:07,439
consulting call with me here for free."

4654
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:08,800
And at the same time, you should also be

4655
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:10,880
doing warm reach outs to anyone that you

4656
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:12,399
have access to and saying, "Hey, would

4657
02:25:12,399 --> 02:25:13,600
anyone that you know be interested in

4658
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:14,640
the stuff that I've been posting about

4659
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:16,240
on my LinkedIn or my on my YouTube?"

4660
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:17,760
Using content and warm reach outs is how

4661
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:18,479
you're going to start to have

4662
02:25:18,479 --> 02:25:19,760
conversations with business owners,

4663
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,280
which is going to lead you down the down

4664
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:22,640
the road towards actually signing your

4665
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:23,760
first couple of clients. And in this

4666
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:25,520
case, number five, I say start working

4667
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:27,200
for free. So, use the skills that you

4668
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:28,880
got from tinkering around, start to put

4669
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:30,319
it into practice, and actually working

4670
02:25:30,319 --> 02:25:32,399
with real businesses and real real

4671
02:25:32,399 --> 02:25:34,080
systems and real data. Uh it's really

4672
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:36,000
key to step up from tinkering to actual

4673
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,520
delivering or at least mocking up some

4674
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:39,359
prototypes for these free clients. And

4675
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:40,880
finally, once you've got the raw rolling

4676
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:41,840
and you've got some rhythm, you're

4677
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:43,280
building your confidence, you can then

4678
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,800
start to increase your prices and hire

4679
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,640
your first developer using the the video

4680
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:47,600
that I've done that I've mentioned

4681
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:48,479
already, which will be down in the

4682
02:25:48,479 --> 02:25:49,840
description if you didn't catch up

4683
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:51,359
there. Next, as a niche agency, it's a

4684
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:52,800
bit of a different strategy. Firstly,

4685
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:54,560
you need to identify a problem to solve.

4686
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:55,760
And this should be either from your

4687
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:57,280
experience or using your connections

4688
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:59,040
experience to identify the problem that

4689
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,319
you want to solve. So once you've got a

4690
02:26:00,319 --> 02:26:01,920
problem to solve, you can then start to

4691
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:03,520
create the prototype yourself by

4692
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:04,800
tinkering around with the tool. Same

4693
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:06,319
sort of thing. Or you can hire a

4694
02:26:06,319 --> 02:26:07,680
developer. And I recommend doing that

4695
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:08,960
through my school community. Go on to

4696
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,000
the school first link in the

4697
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,840
description. Free to sign up. Put a post

4698
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:14,479
up. Hey, I have clients in XYZ niche who

4699
02:26:14,479 --> 02:26:16,160
really want me to build XYZ for them. Is

4700
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:17,359
there anyone in here who can do it for

4701
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:18,479
me? Number three, once you have a

4702
02:26:18,479 --> 02:26:20,560
working prototype or a first version of

4703
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:21,920
the product that you're looking to sell,

4704
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:23,520
go and show it to your warm connections

4705
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:25,200
and ideally find your first client from

4706
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:26,560
one of them and start to implement it

4707
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:27,760
and test it on their business. Step

4708
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:29,600
number four is to continually invest in

4709
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:31,280
improving this product until that client

4710
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:33,120
is happy. So, put in the work, put in

4711
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:34,479
the hours, invest money, whatever you

4712
02:26:34,479 --> 02:26:36,000
need to do to continue to iterate this

4713
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,520
product towards being something that you

4714
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:39,439
can actually start charging for. Um,

4715
02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:40,880
number five, you need to start finding

4716
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,479
more people like that first client that

4717
02:26:42,479 --> 02:26:44,000
you helped and and got a happy result

4718
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:45,439
for using strategies like warm

4719
02:26:45,439 --> 02:26:46,800
reachouts. Contact people that you know

4720
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:48,479
and say, "Hey, I built this thing. Would

4721
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:49,920
you or someone you know be interested in

4722
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:52,000
trying it out in their business xyz?"

4723
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,520
You can also start posting content on

4724
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:54,800
these different platforms. You can start

4725
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:56,080
running ads if you want, and you can

4726
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:57,600
even start doing cold reachouts or or

4727
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:58,880
cold outreach to different people who

4728
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:00,479
have never even heard of you before. And

4729
02:27:00,479 --> 02:27:02,319
step number six is to continue improving

4730
02:27:02,319 --> 02:27:04,240
the product, continue increasing your

4731
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:05,760
prices as you go, and before you know

4732
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:07,120
it, you're running a successful niche

4733
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,800
agency. All righty. So, key takeaways,

4734
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:09,920
making sure that I've done everything I

4735
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:11,600
said I do in this video. Firstly, you

4736
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:12,720
understand the difference between a

4737
02:27:12,720 --> 02:27:14,600
niche and general AI automation agency.

4738
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:17,040
Correct? Secondly, you know the pros and

4739
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:19,920
cons of each. Thirdly, you've decided on

4740
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:21,680
which one is best for you. And finally,

4741
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:23,359
you have a clear plan on your next

4742
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:25,760
steps.

4743
02:27:27,479 --> 02:27:29,600
Over the past two years, I've built and

4744
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:31,840
sold AI automation systems in every

4745
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:33,680
niche imaginable, from international

4746
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:36,000
logistics to martial arts to even

4747
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,680
recently an NBA team. And through my

4748
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:39,760
free and paid communities, I've seen the

4749
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:42,240
successes and the flops of thousands of

4750
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:44,240
AI automation agency owners when it

4751
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:45,600
comes to niching down. And so, I'm

4752
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:46,800
pretty uniquely positioned to know

4753
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:48,479
what's working and what isn't when it

4754
02:27:48,479 --> 02:27:50,560
comes to AI automation agency niches.

4755
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:52,160
And so in this video, I wanted to make

4756
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:53,600
sure as many of you as possible start

4757
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:55,760
the year on the right foot by revealing

4758
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:57,760
my number one pick for AI automation

4759
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:00,399
agency niches in 2025. So if you want to

4760
02:28:00,399 --> 02:28:02,000
start building an AI business or start

4761
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:03,680
making money from the AI space

4762
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:05,359
generally, then you can take my exact

4763
02:28:05,359 --> 02:28:07,280
pick that I would choose right now if I

4764
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:08,960
was to start over. Now, niching down is

4765
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:10,479
of course an extremely important part of

4766
02:28:10,479 --> 02:28:12,479
running a business. It affects basically

4767
02:28:12,479 --> 02:28:14,080
everything you do from the skills you

4768
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:15,040
need to learn like if you're

4769
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:16,720
specializing in a certain area, the

4770
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:17,760
kinds of clients you're going to work

4771
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:19,120
with and be targeting and reaching out

4772
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:21,359
to, the way your business operates in

4773
02:28:21,359 --> 02:28:22,720
terms of the size of the deals you're

4774
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:24,800
going for, the retainer structure or the

4775
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:26,479
payment terms you take. And all of this

4776
02:28:26,479 --> 02:28:28,479
determines really the the feel and how

4777
02:28:28,479 --> 02:28:29,840
the business runs. It's such a

4778
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:30,960
significant part of it and it's

4779
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:32,080
something I see beginners struggling

4780
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:33,520
with all the time. So I wanted to sort

4781
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:35,520
of clarify firstly what niching down is,

4782
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:38,479
right? So your agency niche is what I I

4783
02:28:38,479 --> 02:28:40,479
prefer to call as your agency scope and

4784
02:28:40,479 --> 02:28:42,560
that refers to what you sell and who you

4785
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:44,399
sell it to. So your agency scope can be

4786
02:28:44,399 --> 02:28:46,720
anywhere from completely general to all

4787
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:48,160
the way to fully productized service

4788
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:50,319
where you're selling a specific set of

4789
02:28:50,319 --> 02:28:52,080
specific product or set of products to a

4790
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:53,359
certain set of people or you can be

4791
02:28:53,359 --> 02:28:54,800
completely general and unleashed and do

4792
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:56,160
your best to deliver on everything that

4793
02:28:56,160 --> 02:28:57,760
people ask you for. And so between this

4794
02:28:57,760 --> 02:28:59,840
fully general model and the fully

4795
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:01,680
productized model of selling a specific

4796
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:03,439
set of products to certain people, you

4797
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:04,720
have a lot in between. And you have

4798
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:06,160
basically different shades of niching

4799
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:07,439
down, different stages is what we call

4800
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:08,800
it. And so you can niche down by just

4801
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:10,399
the industry that you're serving. So I

4802
02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:12,000
make AI automation solutions for

4803
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,160
chiropractors or you can niche down by

4804
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:15,680
the category of solutions you provide.

4805
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:18,479
So I make AI voice agents. And so that's

4806
02:29:18,479 --> 02:29:20,319
a way of niching down by solution type.

4807
02:29:20,319 --> 02:29:21,439
And then you can start combining the

4808
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:23,040
both. So you could say, I make AI voice

4809
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:25,439
agents for chiropractors or I make AI

4810
02:29:25,439 --> 02:29:26,720
appointment setting systems or AI

4811
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:28,640
receptionist systems for chiropractors.

4812
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:29,760
And you can start to combine the

4813
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:31,600
industry aspect with the solution

4814
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:33,600
category or the solution type. So it

4815
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:35,280
could be the category of voice agents or

4816
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:37,520
the type of appointment setters or AI

4817
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:38,640
receptionists, right? And then you can

4818
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:40,560
sort of cross them over and be even more

4819
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:41,920
narrowed down by what you sell and who

4820
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:43,600
you're selling to. So that's just a

4821
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:45,520
quick update if you're not familiar on

4822
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:47,200
the sort of niching specifics of AI

4823
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:48,800
automation agencies and the services we

4824
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:49,920
provide. Now that we have that out of

4825
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:51,280
the way, we can move on to what you all

4826
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:52,720
been waiting for, which is my number one

4827
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,359
pick for 2025. Now, as some of you have

4828
02:29:55,359 --> 02:29:57,040
probably guessed, this is a bit of a

4829
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:58,560
trick question, and I'm not just going

4830
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:00,080
to give you one niche because it's

4831
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:01,200
actually not the best process for

4832
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:02,880
picking the niche. the number one niche

4833
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:04,560
for you will be very different to the

4834
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:06,080
number one niche for me and the diff

4835
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:07,200
very different to the number one niche

4836
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:09,120
for someone else. Right? So, give me two

4837
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:10,240
seconds and I'll explain this entire

4838
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:12,640
process, but I'm going to give you a a a

4839
02:30:12,640 --> 02:30:14,160
worksheet or a process that you can go

4840
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:16,160
through to identify the number one niche

4841
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:18,240
for you because business is all about

4842
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:19,920
finding your unfair advantage, your

4843
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:22,160
unique advantage that puts you far above

4844
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:23,680
everyone else and you can really play

4845
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:24,880
your advantage and and that's how you

4846
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:26,560
get ahead. You never want to be joining

4847
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,399
the back of the queue or joining dead in

4848
02:30:28,399 --> 02:30:29,760
the middle where where you are competing

4849
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:31,120
with everyone who's on the same level as

4850
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:32,800
you. All of us have innate strengths

4851
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:34,160
which I'm going to go through here.

4852
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:35,520
Based on your background, based on your

4853
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:37,280
connections, based on your interest, you

4854
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:39,840
need to base your niching strategy on

4855
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:42,000
something that gives you a a unique and

4856
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,920
unfair advantage. For example, in in my

4857
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:45,920
business, Morningside AI, we worked out

4858
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:47,840
that our unique advantage or unfair

4859
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:50,000
advantage is to be building AI

4860
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,600
automation systems for education and

4861
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:53,520
coaching businesses. Why? because I have

4862
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:55,280
my own education coaching business that

4863
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,359
one I deeply understand the problems in

4864
02:30:57,359 --> 02:30:58,720
and therefore I can make much better

4865
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:00,240
systems that people actually want and

4866
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:01,840
two I have my own business to test it

4867
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:03,200
on. So I'm going to go through this

4868
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:04,640
worksheet with you now. This is actually

4869
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:06,080
directly from my accelerator and this is

4870
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:07,600
the first thing that people come in when

4871
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:08,960
they join my program. They go through

4872
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:10,080
this worksheet. So I want to give you

4873
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,439
guys a little freebie of the stuff that

4874
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:12,720
we do inside the accelerator because

4875
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:14,240
this is such an important part to get

4876
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:15,840
right and I thought the new year let's

4877
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:17,200
start everyone off on the right foot as

4878
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:18,319
possible. And so for the rest of this

4879
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:19,359
video, I'm going to be walking you

4880
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:20,880
through the finding your unfair

4881
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:22,240
advantage process that I take all

4882
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:24,000
accelerator members through. And at the

4883
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:24,960
end, I'm going to be sharing with you

4884
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:26,399
how you can get this worksheet yourself.

4885
02:31:26,399 --> 02:31:27,840
And so you can go away and fill that all

4886
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:29,439
out and get the best niche for you in

4887
02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:31,280
2025. So this process of finding your

4888
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:33,280
unfair advantage is really a self audit.

4889
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:34,479
And it's broken into four different

4890
02:31:34,479 --> 02:31:36,880
stages of business access, experience,

4891
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:38,319
connections, and interest. So I'm just

4892
02:31:38,319 --> 02:31:39,600
going to walk through what each of these

4893
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:41,280
is about and why it's so important that

4894
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:42,960
you analyze this first in order to

4895
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:44,399
direct you towards a niche that's best

4896
02:31:44,399 --> 02:31:46,319
for you. So firstly we have business

4897
02:31:46,319 --> 02:31:48,319
access which basically means do you have

4898
02:31:48,319 --> 02:31:49,760
a business that you have access to

4899
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:51,200
whether it's your own. Some people come

4900
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:52,560
into this business model with their own

4901
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:54,800
business that they're coming from or do

4902
02:31:54,800 --> 02:31:56,319
you have access to maybe your your

4903
02:31:56,319 --> 02:31:58,080
parents or your aunties or your uncles

4904
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:00,000
or or or your best friends or someone

4905
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,600
close to you who has a business who will

4906
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:02,960
basically give you access to that

4907
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:05,040
business where you can go in and try to

4908
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,280
identify use cases for AI automation and

4909
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:09,600
you have a very free roam and and low

4910
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:11,120
pressure environment to experiment and

4911
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:12,960
test. This is such a huge advantage and

4912
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:14,240
you should absolutely niche down to

4913
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:16,080
wherever you have access to a business

4914
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:18,000
because it gives you that space to

4915
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,760
experiment and learn it. I promise you

4916
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:21,359
if you were coming into this brand new

4917
02:32:21,359 --> 02:32:22,880
and you're maybe not familiar with AI

4918
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:24,399
automation as a skill set and actually

4919
02:32:24,399 --> 02:32:26,000
doing the technical side or you've never

4920
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,720
run a business before or both then this

4921
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:30,319
kind of freedom that you have and and

4922
02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:32,479
safe space to innovate and test and and

4923
02:32:32,479 --> 02:32:34,560
learn and stumble is the most important

4924
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,920
thing that you could get and by far the

4925
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:37,359
most valuable thing that you could have.

4926
02:32:37,359 --> 02:32:39,280
So that's number one, business access.

4927
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:40,640
And by the end of this process, I'm

4928
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:42,000
going to explain sort of the grading

4929
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,680
criteria on what you should prioritize

4930
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:45,280
and when. But first one is business

4931
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:46,640
access. And I've got a little stat here

4932
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:48,720
for you. According to Startup Genome, on

4933
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:50,560
average, startups have to pivot upwards

4934
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:52,640
of seven times for achieving product

4935
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:54,880
market fit. So when you come into this

4936
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:56,479
new business and you're trying to find a

4937
02:32:56,479 --> 02:32:58,080
solution that you can sell that is

4938
02:32:58,080 --> 02:32:59,439
really creating value for people and you

4939
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:01,600
can sell repeatedly to other businesses,

4940
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:03,040
you may have to go into this business

4941
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:05,040
you have access to and try this and try

4942
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:06,479
this and try this up to seven or more

4943
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:08,000
times until you find something that's

4944
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,439
actually worthwhile. So that's just like

4945
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:10,720
setting the expectations and when you

4946
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:12,640
have that safe environment to do it by

4947
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:14,080
far the best thing. So that should be

4948
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:15,600
your number one pick. The second part of

4949
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:17,200
this self audit is centered around

4950
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:18,560
experience. So all of your past

4951
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:20,160
experience and the idea with this is

4952
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:22,080
that if you have maybe worked in the

4953
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:23,920
landscaping industry before or worked in

4954
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:25,680
the insurance space before, the

4955
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:27,040
experience that you gained in those

4956
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,560
years or maybe decades that you worked

4957
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:30,080
in it is going to allow you to

4958
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:31,680
understand the unique problems that that

4959
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:33,840
industry faces so that you can create a

4960
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:35,359
product or service around solving that

4961
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:36,640
problem. Business is all about value

4962
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:38,560
creation through problem solving. And so

4963
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:40,240
the core of anything you're trying to do

4964
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:41,359
when you're starting a new business is

4965
02:33:41,359 --> 02:33:43,200
finding a valuable problem to solve. And

4966
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:44,960
so the experience you've gained allows

4967
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:46,640
it's firsthand experience, right? So

4968
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:48,479
this is allowing you to really pinpoint

4969
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:49,840
and target something that you know is

4970
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:51,840
painful that you are kind of data backed

4971
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:52,880
is what I try to tell all the

4972
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:54,160
accelerator members. Try to find some

4973
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:56,640
either firsthand or secondhand data that

4974
02:33:56,640 --> 02:33:58,240
this is a problem that's worth solving

4975
02:33:58,240 --> 02:33:59,439
so that you can start off on the right

4976
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:01,280
foot. I have another a stat here.

4977
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:02,560
Basically, this is going to remove a lot

4978
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:03,920
of the guesswork for you because if you

4979
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:04,880
come into a niche where you're

4980
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:06,399
completely new to it, you're going to

4981
02:34:06,399 --> 02:34:08,479
go, I'll go on Reddit. I'll watch some

4982
02:34:08,479 --> 02:34:09,920
YouTube videos. Sure, you can you can

4983
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:11,200
guess your way, but it is literally

4984
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:12,479
guessing what problems need to be

4985
02:34:12,479 --> 02:34:13,840
solved. And again, I want to remind you

4986
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:15,439
of that stat. Startups have to pivot

4987
02:34:15,439 --> 02:34:17,200
upwards of seven times before achieving

4988
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:18,399
product market fit where they have

4989
02:34:18,399 --> 02:34:19,840
something that really serves the needs

4990
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:20,880
of the market that they're trying to

4991
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:23,200
serve. So, by doing this and

4992
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:24,800
prioritizing niching down based on your

4993
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:26,479
experience and understanding problems

4994
02:34:26,479 --> 02:34:28,880
that that particular niche has, you get

4995
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:30,399
to eliminate as much of that guesswork

4996
02:34:30,399 --> 02:34:32,160
and sort of jumping around as possible.

4997
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:33,840
And ideally, you just bang the nail on

4998
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:34,960
the head the first time. It's probably

4999
02:34:34,960 --> 02:34:36,160
not going to happen. You probably are

5000
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:37,280
going to need a couple little pivots

5001
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:38,800
with the product or the service that you

5002
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:40,800
do, but you can sort of get the general

5003
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:42,240
area right first time. And that's why

5004
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:43,840
experience is so important. The third

5005
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,760
stage of the self audit is based on your

5006
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:47,680
connection. So, who you know, who you

5007
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:48,960
have relationships with. They might have

5008
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:50,479
been friends, colleagues, anyone in your

5009
02:34:50,479 --> 02:34:52,240
family even. Basically any connections

5010
02:34:52,240 --> 02:34:54,640
that will allow you to either firstly

5011
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:56,399
talk to them and say hey what problems

5012
02:34:56,399 --> 02:34:58,000
and try to like leech off their

5013
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,280
experience and like I said the

5014
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:00,640
experience of firsthand like what

5015
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:02,160
problems are actually in this industry

5016
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:04,080
is ideal but if you have connections who

5017
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:05,600
have maybe 10 years experience in a

5018
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:07,040
certain industry you can have a

5019
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:08,319
conversation with them and say hey look

5020
02:35:08,319 --> 02:35:09,680
what are the main problems that you're

5021
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:10,960
facing on the dayto-day can you sit down

5022
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:12,319
with me for a bit maybe you need to pay

5023
02:35:12,319 --> 02:35:13,520
them a little bit if you're not very

5024
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:14,880
good friends with them or the connection

5025
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:16,479
isn't very strong or if it's a family

5026
02:35:16,479 --> 02:35:18,319
member take them out for dinner or or go

5027
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:19,600
make dinner for them if you're truly

5028
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:21,760
trying to be a good family member and

5029
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:23,120
have a chat with them. Say, "Walk me

5030
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:24,000
through the biggest problems you're

5031
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,840
facing in your business." And really try

5032
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:27,840
to absorb all of the information and

5033
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:28,880
understanding they have of their niche

5034
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:30,160
and the problems that they face so that

5035
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:32,080
you can then go and create some ideas of

5036
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:33,520
services and products you can recommend

5037
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:34,880
to them. Say, "Hey, how would you like

5038
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:36,399
this? What about this? If I could build

5039
02:35:36,399 --> 02:35:37,600
this automation that would take this off

5040
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,479
your plate, would that be really

5041
02:35:38,479 --> 02:35:39,920
valuable?" And you just use them as a

5042
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:41,439
sounding board and go back and forth.

5043
02:35:41,439 --> 02:35:43,280
And the second part of why connections

5044
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:45,439
can be so valuable is that one firstly

5045
02:35:45,439 --> 02:35:47,200
they could be a a first client for you

5046
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:48,560
or a free client that you get to build

5047
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:50,080
it for. But more importantly, they could

5048
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:51,200
also have if they've been in the

5049
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:52,399
industry for a long time, have an

5050
02:35:52,399 --> 02:35:54,399
extensive set of connections and you can

5051
02:35:54,399 --> 02:35:55,680
say, "Hey, look, let's let's cut a deal

5052
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:57,439
here. Well, we've we've dialed it in.

5053
02:35:57,439 --> 02:35:58,479
We've got it really working on your

5054
02:35:58,479 --> 02:36:00,720
business or in your example, um, now we

5055
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:02,080
can take it and sell to other people. do

5056
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:03,760
you want to do a deal where um I can

5057
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:05,520
sell it for $4,000 and I'll give you a

5058
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:07,520
cut 50/50 or what you know you can do

5059
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:08,960
whatever cut you want there just to get

5060
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:10,000
things off the ground and they can

5061
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,439
actually help you with the distribution

5062
02:36:11,439 --> 02:36:13,439
and they can provide referral leads and

5063
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:15,120
referral leads according to some of the

5064
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:16,880
data that I've I've found for us

5065
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:18,560
referrals as in people say your

5066
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:20,160
connection referring someone to you and

5067
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:21,520
saying hey look I know this guy who's

5068
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:23,439
got this really cool AI system or this

5069
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:24,960
great AI offer for for your consulting

5070
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:26,880
or education according to refer reach

5071
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:28,399
B2B organizations with referrals

5072
02:36:28,399 --> 02:36:31,600
encounter a 71% higher conversion rate

5073
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:33,760
You also have faster deals overall with

5074
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:36,319
69% of B2B sales personnel believing

5075
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:38,640
that referred leads close faster than

5076
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:40,640
other leads per refer reach statistics.

5077
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:42,080
And finally, you get higher value

5078
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:43,680
customers through referrals as well. The

5079
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:45,040
Wharton School of Business found that

5080
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:47,200
referred customers have 16% higher

5081
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:49,280
lifetime value on average. Right? So

5082
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,200
massive benefits to referrals. So you

5083
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:52,720
can use connections in two ways. Either

5084
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:54,160
to learn more about their problems they

5085
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:55,200
face and really leverage their

5086
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:56,399
understanding of the problems that they

5087
02:36:56,399 --> 02:36:58,240
face on the dayto-day and then use them

5088
02:36:58,240 --> 02:36:59,920
as distribution partners if possible. So

5089
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:01,520
that's why connections are a massive win

5090
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:02,880
if you're trying to pick a niche where

5091
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:04,720
you have an unfair advantage. And the

5092
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:06,319
final part of the self audit to find

5093
02:37:06,319 --> 02:37:08,640
your best niche for 2025 is based on

5094
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:10,640
your interest. What are you what gets

5095
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:11,920
you really excited? What gets you

5096
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:13,760
motivated and you're really curious

5097
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:15,200
about what what the potential is for

5098
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:16,560
this certain area. Your interest maybe

5099
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:18,240
centered around a certain niche is then

5100
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:19,600
like man I'm really interested in

5101
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:21,760
learning how I mean trades people. I

5102
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:23,200
keep using the example of plumbers. I

5103
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:24,640
just think it's so interesting that at

5104
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:26,240
some point plumbers are going to be

5105
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:28,000
using AI throughout their business and I

5106
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,040
mean someone's going to be the ones to

5107
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:30,560
facilitate that and sort of map out the

5108
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:33,280
the plumber AI stack, you know, I think

5109
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:34,800
that's pretty interesting to me. I don't

5110
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:36,479
I don't know why. But if you you may be

5111
02:37:36,479 --> 02:37:39,120
interested in a certain niche and how AI

5112
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:40,319
can affect that and really help

5113
02:37:40,319 --> 02:37:42,080
businesses grow or or have some impact

5114
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:44,240
in overall like there's agriculture cool

5115
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:45,840
stuff going on. There's healthcare, but

5116
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:47,359
I'd probably stick to something sort of

5117
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:48,960
more basic service-based business if

5118
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:50,399
possible. But again, your interest is an

5119
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:51,439
interest. And aside from just the

5120
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:52,560
industry that you could be interested

5121
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:54,479
in, you could be interested in the

5122
02:37:54,479 --> 02:37:56,399
solution type or the category saying,

5123
02:37:56,399 --> 02:37:58,160
"Hey, like I'm really interested in this

5124
02:37:58,160 --> 02:37:59,359
AI appointment setting thing. I think

5125
02:37:59,359 --> 02:38:00,960
there's so much value to be created with

5126
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:02,399
these systems and taking humans away

5127
02:38:02,399 --> 02:38:03,840
from doing this mundane stuff and

5128
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:05,280
allowing them to focus I think AI

5129
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:06,560
appointment sets are really cool and I

5130
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:08,080
really want to go deep on that." Or it

5131
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:10,000
might be the solution category. So type

5132
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,680
is like the specific the category as the

5133
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:13,840
whole and the solution category of hey I

5134
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:16,080
think these AI voice agents have a lot

5135
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:17,200
of potential and I'm really interested

5136
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:19,359
and I like seeing where that's going. So

5137
02:38:19,359 --> 02:38:21,680
an interest is an extremely good way of

5138
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:23,439
of picking an unfair advantage because

5139
02:38:23,439 --> 02:38:25,359
if you have like I go back to Naval a

5140
02:38:25,359 --> 02:38:27,520
lot on this Navar Raikant um he says do

5141
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:28,960
what feels like play to you but may look

5142
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:30,640
like work to others and this comes back

5143
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:32,880
to his concept of specific knowledge and

5144
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:34,399
he calls that stuff that you you can't

5145
02:38:34,399 --> 02:38:35,600
go to school and be taught it. So

5146
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:37,680
specific knowledge might be knowing end

5147
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:39,840
to end how to implement an AI sales

5148
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:41,520
co-pilot system. You can go to school

5149
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:42,800
and get taught math. You can go to get

5150
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:43,840
school and taught the basics of

5151
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:45,439
economics, but you couldn't necessarily

5152
02:38:45,439 --> 02:38:47,120
go to school or university and be taught

5153
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:49,120
end to end how to implement an AI sales

5154
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:50,640
co-pilot, right? There's a lot of extra

5155
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:52,080
I could tell you the steps and you could

5156
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:53,760
understand it, but the actual

5157
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:55,120
implementation of that, there's a lot of

5158
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:56,399
extra stuff and specific knowledge

5159
02:38:56,399 --> 02:38:57,760
that's gained like the the potholes

5160
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:59,120
along the way that you need to dodge.

5161
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:00,640
And so he says specific knowledge like

5162
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:02,160
this is extremely valuable and we should

5163
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:04,000
all try to find it to be to be very

5164
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,920
successful. And specific knowledge is

5165
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:07,840
found much more by pursuing your innate

5166
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:09,920
talents, your genuine curiosity, and

5167
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:12,399
your passions. If you're not 100% into

5168
02:39:12,399 --> 02:39:15,040
it, somebody else who is 100% into it

5169
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:16,640
will outperform you. And they won't just

5170
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:18,399
outperform you by a little bit. They'll

5171
02:39:18,399 --> 02:39:20,080
outperform you by a lot. And so to bring

5172
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:21,439
this back to niching down and finding

5173
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:23,520
your unfair advantages here, I can use

5174
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,920
the example of myself at least. Um I am

5175
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:27,920
absolutely obsessed with this AI and

5176
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:29,840
business thing. And it is just and in

5177
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:31,120
content creation as well. This is

5178
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:32,800
something it's just I found the perfect

5179
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:34,399
mixture of things that interest me and

5180
02:39:34,399 --> 02:39:35,840
that I'm good at. And that's why you

5181
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:36,880
have seen me if you guys have been

5182
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:38,800
watching me for a while really just

5183
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:39,920
absolutely take off in the past few

5184
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:41,680
years. And I'm so grateful for that. And

5185
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:43,040
while I am of course grateful for the

5186
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:44,640
monetary stuff and everything that comes

5187
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:45,920
with it, but I'm actually more grateful

5188
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,840
that I found something as a job and as a

5189
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:49,920
as a career that combines all of my

5190
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:52,000
interest and also matches my my talent

5191
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,520
and skills, if you want to call it that.

5192
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:55,200
And I've seen time and time again people

5193
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:57,120
try to copy what I'm doing or try to

5194
02:39:57,120 --> 02:39:59,359
also get into AI cuz they just see it as

5195
02:39:59,359 --> 02:40:01,520
a shiny object and because they don't

5196
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:03,359
actually love it, they just get like a

5197
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:04,720
fraction of the results that myself and

5198
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:07,200
my team have got. So please if you are

5199
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:09,600
looking for any the the interest and

5200
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:10,800
something that actually motivates you

5201
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:12,560
and you're really interested in is a

5202
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:14,160
significant factor but I do see interest

5203
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:16,080
and passion as a nice to have in this

5204
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,760
case and also as a last resort. So if

5205
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:19,280
you give me a second I'll break down how

5206
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:20,319
these different things. We've got

5207
02:40:20,319 --> 02:40:22,000
business access, we've got experience,

5208
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,840
we've got connections and interest. So

5209
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:25,280
breaking down the scoring criteria,

5210
02:40:25,280 --> 02:40:27,280
business access is number one. If you

5211
02:40:27,280 --> 02:40:28,640
looking to pick your ideal niche for

5212
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:30,640
2025, wherever you have access to a

5213
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:32,080
business should be the place you start.

5214
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,760
That is by far the most important thing.

5215
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:35,120
Even if you're not super interested in

5216
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:37,200
it, trust me, if you start making

5217
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:38,880
progress and making money from it, you

5218
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:40,080
kind of get naturally interested in it

5219
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:41,439
as well to a certain degree. And if you

5220
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:42,800
don't have business access, the second

5221
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:44,560
best option is a niche where you have

5222
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:46,720
both experience and connections, right?

5223
02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:47,920
So if you have experience, know the

5224
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:49,680
problems, connections to help sell that

5225
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:52,000
and distribute it. That's second best.

5226
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,359
And then third best is if you have

5227
02:40:53,359 --> 02:40:55,200
either connections or experience. So one

5228
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:57,600
or the other, that's third best. And

5229
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:59,600
number four is if you don't have any of

5230
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:01,200
those options, you just have some

5231
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:03,520
interest in hey oh these these like AI

5232
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:05,359
automation and building things on make

5233
02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:06,880
an air table and stuff seems interest or

5234
02:41:06,880 --> 02:41:08,479
I'm interested in voice agents. Just

5235
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:10,560
having some kind of interest is the the

5236
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:12,479
bare minimum and in the bottom bottom

5237
02:41:12,479 --> 02:41:15,120
tier of this. However, interest can also

5238
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:16,560
be added on top of all of those. So if

5239
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:17,680
you have business access and you're

5240
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:19,280
really into it, that's even better. If

5241
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:20,640
you have business or if you have

5242
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:22,160
experience and connections and you're

5243
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:23,600
really obsessed about it, then that's

5244
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:24,960
even better. So interest is more of like

5245
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:27,760
a nice to have and like a jet fuel or a

5246
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:29,200
rocket booster that you can strap on to

5247
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:31,200
your your niching selection and your

5248
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:32,399
business as a whole. But if you do have

5249
02:41:32,399 --> 02:41:33,680
the business access, experience,

5250
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:35,280
connections, etc. and don't have

5251
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:36,880
interest, don't worry about it. But

5252
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:38,479
again, to reiterate, priority should be

5253
02:41:38,479 --> 02:41:39,840
business access and then experience

5254
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:42,000
connections. Interest is a nice to have.

5255
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,520
And also, if you don't have any of those

5256
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:46,960
three, then interest is is a is a good

5257
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:48,479
last resort. So if you don't have any

5258
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:50,399
other option, do what you interested in.

5259
02:41:50,399 --> 02:41:51,680
All right, so that's the breakdown. And

5260
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:52,960
and if you don't have anything that

5261
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:54,800
you're interested in the AI space, then

5262
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:56,800
go out and watch some videos. Go and

5263
02:41:56,800 --> 02:41:58,240
watch more of my stuff, watch more of

5264
02:41:58,240 --> 02:41:59,600
other people's videos. There's so much

5265
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:01,040
out there. If you just find something to

5266
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:02,240
latch on to and you go, "Wow, that's

5267
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:03,760
interesting." You feel that pull like

5268
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:04,880
you want to go and have a have a play

5269
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:06,399
around or learn more about it. That is

5270
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:07,359
your niche and that's what you should

5271
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:09,200
stick to. So, I want to just wrap this

5272
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:10,399
up now. It's probably been a bit longer

5273
02:42:10,399 --> 02:42:11,680
than I planned, but I got a little bit

5274
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:13,680
of extra explanations in there to share

5275
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:15,920
with you guys. But the resource that I

5276
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:17,040
want to give away is actually directly

5277
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:18,960
from the accelerator, as I said. So, my

5278
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:20,399
accelerator program, paid program, I

5279
02:42:20,399 --> 02:42:21,920
have my free community as well. Soon as

5280
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:23,439
they come into my accelerator, they use

5281
02:42:23,439 --> 02:42:24,720
this exact worksheet that I'm going to

5282
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:26,160
give you access to. And to get access to

5283
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:27,439
it, it'll be in the first link in the

5284
02:42:27,439 --> 02:42:28,640
description. You go in and fill out a

5285
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:29,840
little form. Then it's going to be sent

5286
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:31,439
to you directly via email. Um, and

5287
02:42:31,439 --> 02:42:32,479
that's how you can get this entire

5288
02:42:32,479 --> 02:42:33,840
worksheet that I put my accelerator

5289
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:35,280
members through. So, again, sorry to

5290
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:36,479
bait and switch you with that title.

5291
02:42:36,479 --> 02:42:37,840
But, I hope you got to the end of it and

5292
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:38,720
you realize that I'm actually trying to

5293
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:40,160
do this for your own good. Don't let

5294
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:41,840
someone like me or other people be like,

5295
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:43,200
"That's the right niche for you. You

5296
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:44,560
need to do this." Unless I sit down and

5297
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:45,359
have a chat with you, of course, and

5298
02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:46,800
you're on my Q&A in the free community,

5299
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:48,960
but I don't know. Don't like try to be

5300
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:50,640
spoonfed either, oh, I heard there's a

5301
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:51,760
lot of money in real estate, so I'll

5302
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:53,280
guess we'll go into real estate. No, use

5303
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:54,560
your brain. Follow the exact process

5304
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:56,160
I've just given you. By far the most

5305
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:57,359
important thing you can do because you

5306
02:42:57,359 --> 02:42:58,640
want to do work that feels like play to

5307
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:00,479
you or you have a ridiculous unfair

5308
02:43:00,479 --> 02:43:02,800
advantage

5309
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:06,399
in struggling to make money with AI,

5310
02:43:06,399 --> 02:43:07,920
then this graph is probably going to

5311
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:10,000
tell you what's wrong with your strategy

5312
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,600
and uh I'm going to help you fix it and

5313
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:12,560
understand everything about this.

5314
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:14,479
There's multiple layers to this. Um, and

5315
02:43:14,479 --> 02:43:16,160
I've also done an excellent drawing

5316
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:17,359
here. So, you can leave a like on the

5317
02:43:17,359 --> 02:43:19,520
video purely for the drawing. Um, but

5318
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:20,640
there's a lot to this and I'm going to

5319
02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:21,920
try to break it down for you so that you

5320
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:23,680
can actually be successful in the AI

5321
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:25,120
space because not understanding what

5322
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:27,600
this graph means is is the most one of

5323
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:28,800
the most common reasons that I'm seeing

5324
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:30,479
of people not succeeding cuz it's if you

5325
02:43:30,479 --> 02:43:31,920
don't understand it, you apply the wrong

5326
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:33,920
strategies to acquire customers and it's

5327
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:35,840
really like the the foundational

5328
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:38,000
paradigm of of understanding this the

5329
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:39,680
the adoption of AI technology which is

5330
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:42,240
what we are writing as AI agency owners.

5331
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:46,399
This is called the technology adoption

5332
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:49,200
life cycle. Now what this graph uh

5333
02:43:49,200 --> 02:43:51,040
outlines and really details let me get

5334
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:53,760
my other pens here. Um is the adoption

5335
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:55,359
of new technologies. Now we see this

5336
02:43:55,359 --> 02:43:56,479
it's a pattern that they've recognized.

5337
02:43:56,479 --> 02:43:58,319
I'm not sure who I attribute it to but

5338
02:43:58,319 --> 02:43:59,920
uh this is used to describe basically

5339
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:02,399
the adoption of any technology. Um and

5340
02:44:02,399 --> 02:44:03,680
we have multiple stages here and the

5341
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:04,960
multiple stages represent different

5342
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:06,720
portions of the population and the speed

5343
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:08,319
and and rate at which they adopt new

5344
02:44:08,319 --> 02:44:10,399
technology. So uh firstly we have the

5345
02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:13,600
innovators, we have the early adopters,

5346
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:16,880
we have the early majority, early match

5347
02:44:16,880 --> 02:44:19,040
um and we have the late majority late

5348
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:21,520
match and we have the uh what are these

5349
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:23,720
guys? The laggers, right?

5350
02:44:23,720 --> 02:44:27,520
Lag gods. So these are different

5351
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:29,520
sections of the population. These guys

5352
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:32,279
are a handy dandy

5353
02:44:32,279 --> 02:44:35,800
2.5%. These guys are a

5354
02:44:35,800 --> 02:44:37,680
13.5%. I don't know who made these

5355
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:38,880
numbers up, but someone's smarter than

5356
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:41,200
me probably. Um, these guys are, I

5357
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:43,000
believe it's like

5358
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:47,000
34%. Um, these guys are another

5359
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,279
34%. And these guys are the remainder. I

5360
02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:50,319
can't remember exactly what. No one

5361
02:44:50,319 --> 02:44:51,760
cares about these guys really cuz we're

5362
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:53,760
not going to be selling to lagards. Um,

5363
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:55,600
so forgive me for not remember. You do

5364
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:58,319
the math. You can figure it out. Um, but

5365
02:44:58,319 --> 02:45:00,000
so we have the innovators, the early

5366
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,359
adopters, the early majority, the late

5367
02:45:01,359 --> 02:45:03,200
majority, and lagards. And in between

5368
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:06,960
these two we have what is known as the

5369
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:09,439
chasm. Now it was Jeffrey Moore has a

5370
02:45:09,439 --> 02:45:12,319
book uh called crossing the chasm and

5371
02:45:12,319 --> 02:45:15,520
this chasm describes um the the gap that

5372
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:17,439
forms between early adopters and the

5373
02:45:17,439 --> 02:45:18,960
early majority that a lot of software

5374
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:21,200
companies uh struggle to bridge. So you

5375
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:22,640
might get a couple of early adopters to

5376
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:24,000
your technology and to your to your

5377
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:25,920
software, but you struggle to jump into

5378
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:27,680
this bigger pool of people and cross

5379
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:29,359
this chasm which has got a nice little

5380
02:45:29,359 --> 02:45:31,279
skull here um over into the early

5381
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:32,560
majority so that you can then start to

5382
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,560
sell it to more people. So why am I

5383
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:38,200
telling you this? Well, we sell

5384
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:40,720
technology and AI is the technology that

5385
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:43,120
we are selling primarily, right? So if

5386
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:45,600
we understand how these different

5387
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:47,920
segments of the population uh need to be

5388
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:50,240
marketed to, how we can find them, what

5389
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:51,680
stage we're currently at, if you can

5390
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:53,279
understand this stuff fundamentally,

5391
02:45:53,279 --> 02:45:55,359
then you can create a strategy on how

5392
02:45:55,359 --> 02:45:57,760
you can create and and run your business

5393
02:45:57,760 --> 02:46:00,319
that utilizes the the underlying effects

5394
02:46:00,319 --> 02:46:01,840
of the market. So the market dynamics

5395
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:03,200
are absolutely key to understand or

5396
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:05,040
you're going to use the wrong the wrong

5397
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:06,640
paintbrush on the wrong canvas or

5398
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:08,720
something. some fancy analogy there that

5399
02:46:08,720 --> 02:46:09,840
makes sense. But you're using the wrong

5400
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:12,279
tool uh the wrong tool for the job

5401
02:46:12,279 --> 02:46:14,560
basically. So these each of these

5402
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:16,960
components well these these sectors have

5403
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:18,560
their own qualities to them. Uh now you

5404
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:19,680
need to understand these qualities. So

5405
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:21,439
let's go through them. The innovators

5406
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:23,439
are sort of more interested well they

5407
02:46:23,439 --> 02:46:25,279
might have a lot of money. Often times

5408
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:27,200
they have some money and resources to

5409
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:28,640
throw at this thing cuz it's not going

5410
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:30,080
to make much money. It's not very useful

5411
02:46:30,080 --> 02:46:31,439
but this technology is exciting to them

5412
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:33,120
and they're willing to be invested in

5413
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:35,359
it. Um, like I said, they're more like

5414
02:46:35,359 --> 02:46:37,680
tech versus use case. They see the

5415
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:39,439
potential in the tech more than than

5416
02:46:39,439 --> 02:46:40,640
anything else. They're not too worried

5417
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:42,880
about uh the rest of the stuff. Um, so

5418
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:44,880
the innovators, um, then you have the

5419
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:47,200
early adopters. The early adopters are

5420
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:49,120
people who are kind of the the

5421
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:50,720
visionaries and these are people who

5422
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:52,080
look at this technology that these guys

5423
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:53,840
have been tinkering around with and they

5424
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:55,840
go, "Wow, I understand how that can be

5425
02:46:55,840 --> 02:46:57,520
used. I'm going to try and create the

5426
02:46:57,520 --> 02:46:58,960
first sort of implementations of that

5427
02:46:58,960 --> 02:47:00,800
and stretch this from a little sciency

5428
02:47:00,800 --> 02:47:03,800
like these are often academics

5429
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:06,640
academics. Oops. These are academics and

5430
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:07,760
they're sort of experimenting around

5431
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:09,120
with things and then people bring it

5432
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:11,120
into uh these visionaries and the early

5433
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:13,520
adopters will take it and sort of apply

5434
02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:15,120
it to some real world use cases and

5435
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:16,800
start to stretch the capabilities so

5436
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:19,200
that it can really come into its own. Um

5437
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:21,760
these guys are not too much worried

5438
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:24,000
about the see they're more just excited,

5439
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
right?

5440
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,080
and they are looking at this technology

5441
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:29,359
as a new thing that they can take and

5442
02:47:29,359 --> 02:47:30,960
take to the world. Then we have the

5443
02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:33,040
early majority. These are people who are

5444
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:35,000
a little bit more

5445
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,680
pragmatic

5446
02:47:36,680 --> 02:47:42,520
matic. U they rely on more

5447
02:47:42,520 --> 02:47:45,240
proof

5448
02:47:45,240 --> 02:47:47,359
evidence and can best really be

5449
02:47:47,359 --> 02:47:49,479
described as

5450
02:47:49,479 --> 02:47:52,840
weight and

5451
02:47:52,840 --> 02:47:55,600
see. Um so these guys uh the early

5452
02:47:55,600 --> 02:47:58,560
majority the reason technology companies

5453
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:00,160
and and technologies as a whole kind of

5454
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:01,600
failed to bridge this gap and cross the

5455
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:04,080
chasm is because this early majority and

5456
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:06,399
everything beyond they want proof they

5457
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:08,319
want evidence. They want to wait to be

5458
02:48:08,319 --> 02:48:09,840
sure about something new before they

5459
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:11,600
take a risk on it. So they're lot more

5460
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:14,000
riskaverse. These guys are sort of risk

5461
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,600
takers and again they're they're more

5462
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:17,120
focused the early majority are more

5463
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:18,560
focused on the potential of it rather

5464
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:21,040
than the the current sort of efficiency

5465
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:23,439
and and output of it. Right? The early

5466
02:48:23,439 --> 02:48:25,040
majority pragmatic, need more proof.

5467
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:26,960
They wait and see. Late majority, it's a

5468
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:28,160
little bit more. They're sort of a

5469
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:29,600
little bit more. That's these guys are

5470
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:31,520
conservative. These guys are skeptical.

5471
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:32,560
Now, I'm not going to go into all this

5472
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:34,080
cuz we're not really dealing with with

5473
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:36,880
those guys. Um, but what I'm trying to

5474
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:38,240
teach you and explain to you something

5475
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:40,399
that's made me successful in the space.

5476
02:48:40,399 --> 02:48:43,040
I've I've made now over a million

5477
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:45,200
dollars selling this AI stuff. Um, and

5478
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:46,720
since I started my AI journey. So, I

5479
02:48:46,720 --> 02:48:48,080
feel like I'm kind of qualified and

5480
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:49,279
without understanding this, I wouldn't

5481
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:50,960
have made nearly nearly as much as what

5482
02:48:50,960 --> 02:48:52,880
I have. So, I'm trying to communicate

5483
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:54,319
this to you all because I'm I'm it

5484
02:48:54,319 --> 02:48:56,000
really hurts me hurts me seeing so many

5485
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:57,600
of you trying to I'm waving these things

5486
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:59,359
around. It hurts me to see so many of

5487
02:48:59,359 --> 02:49:00,640
you trying to succeed and I know how

5488
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:02,080
hard you're working on your agencies and

5489
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:03,920
trying to build them and sell solutions,

5490
02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:05,760
but you're using the wrong tool for the

5491
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:07,520
job and it comes down to understanding

5492
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:10,080
this. So, stick with me cuz we got a lot

5493
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:12,240
more to cover. All right, so the early

5494
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:13,840
adopters and the early majority is

5495
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:15,840
really the focus where AI is right now

5496
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:17,680
is we are in this early adopters phase

5497
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:19,359
and we're kind of crossing the chasm

5498
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:21,600
into the early majority. Now, who is our

5499
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:23,279
market, it's business owners. So, we

5500
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:24,720
need to think of this as not the

5501
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:27,040
consumer market, not not people in their

5502
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:29,359
their their nan going on and using ch.

5503
02:49:29,359 --> 02:49:30,240
That's not what we're talking about.

5504
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:32,240
We're talking about the adoption of AI

5505
02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:34,319
technology within businesses, which is a

5506
02:49:34,319 --> 02:49:35,439
it's a different curve. They all have

5507
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:36,960
their own places and and ages and

5508
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:40,080
stages, but this is part specifically

5509
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:44,000
for businesses. Now, how can we take

5510
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:45,680
what we've understood from this in the

5511
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:46,800
different stages of people? But these

5512
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:47,840
are visionaries, they're excited,

5513
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:50,000
they're risktakers. Um they they want to

5514
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:51,120
try the technology and they want to

5515
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:53,279
apply it to to use cases. And then we

5516
02:49:53,279 --> 02:49:55,040
have the gap and the chasm that goes to

5517
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:57,359
these people here who are a much larger

5518
02:49:57,359 --> 02:49:59,920
section, the 34 over over double nearly

5519
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:01,840
three times as much. Um so we really

5520
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:03,120
want to be tapping into these at some

5521
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:06,160
point. But for those of you who are

5522
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:08,160
starting your AI agencies, you may be

5523
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:09,920
looking at this and seeing an issue,

5524
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:12,520
right? So if I'm trying to sell to early

5525
02:50:12,520 --> 02:50:15,120
majority who are wait and see, they're

5526
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:17,200
evidence-based. They want more proof.

5527
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:19,439
They're pragmatic. How in the hell am I

5528
02:50:19,439 --> 02:50:22,240
going to sell my AI solutions if I've

5529
02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:23,760
never sold one before? I don't have any

5530
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:25,359
proof. I don't have any evidence. The

5531
02:50:25,359 --> 02:50:27,200
use case I'm trying to sell them is not

5532
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:28,720
something that I have evidence to prove

5533
02:50:28,720 --> 02:50:30,640
that works. So maybe selling these AI

5534
02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:33,040
callers and the AI AI calling systems.

5535
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:34,880
Sure, early adopters look at that like

5536
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:36,399
me and you look at that and go, "Wow,

5537
02:50:36,399 --> 02:50:38,520
that's cool. I see the

5538
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:41,000
potential

5539
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,279
potential." We are visionaries. We see

5540
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:44,960
the potential of the technology. But

5541
02:50:44,960 --> 02:50:46,560
when you're trying to sell to people who

5542
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:50,080
need proof, you're talking they're deaf.

5543
02:50:50,080 --> 02:50:52,000
It's falling on deaf ears. So, how can

5544
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,399
we tailor our strategy as AI agency

5545
02:50:54,399 --> 02:50:57,200
owners when we're getting started to use

5546
02:50:57,200 --> 02:50:59,279
this to our advantage and plan our

5547
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:00,880
strategy according to the different

5548
02:51:00,880 --> 02:51:03,760
pools of people in the market. So, I'm

5549
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:05,439
glad you asked. What you want to do when

5550
02:51:05,439 --> 02:51:07,600
you're starting agency is not go for

5551
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:08,960
these people because you don't have the

5552
02:51:08,960 --> 02:51:12,240
proof. You need to find early adopters.

5553
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:14,560
And in order to find early adopters, uh,

5554
02:51:14,560 --> 02:51:16,000
but they're a small segment and I guess

5555
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:17,359
innovator is kind of included in this as

5556
02:51:17,359 --> 02:51:18,960
well, right? So they're sort of a a

5557
02:51:18,960 --> 02:51:20,960
group that you can sell to collectively,

5558
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:23,120
but in order to find them, these are

5559
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:24,560
already a small segment of the

5560
02:51:24,560 --> 02:51:28,840
population. This is what um 14

5561
02:51:28,840 --> 02:51:31,760
16%. And meaning you have all of these

5562
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:34,319
people that you cannot even attempt to

5563
02:51:34,319 --> 02:51:36,560
sell to without any proof or without any

5564
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:38,479
evidence as to as to the the the results

5565
02:51:38,479 --> 02:51:40,000
that your systems can get. So, keeping

5566
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,880
this in mind, how should we be trying to

5567
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:46,640
sell our solutions? By cold email, by

5568
02:51:46,640 --> 02:51:48,560
reaching out to people via Instagram, by

5569
02:51:48,560 --> 02:51:51,680
LinkedIn, cold DMs. Well, I hope I've

5570
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:53,279
got enough room on the screen here, but

5571
02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:54,920
let's just say we have

5572
02:51:54,920 --> 02:52:00,000
a a box of 100 people, but but this is

5573
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:03,200
10 by 10, right? 10 by 10. And then I'm

5574
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:06,240
sending my cold emails and I have a list

5575
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:07,520
of thousands and thousands of people. In

5576
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:10,000
this case, let's just use 100. And I'm

5577
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,800
sending out these emails. And um let's

5578
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:18,279
let's fill this out. 5 6 7 8 9 10.

5579
02:52:18,279 --> 02:52:22,359
Um 2 3 4

5580
02:52:22,359 --> 02:52:26,240
5. Um yeah. There. So this is imagine

5581
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:27,359
this is filled out. I'm not going to

5582
02:52:27,359 --> 02:52:28,800
draw it obviously cuz there's there's

5583
02:52:28,800 --> 02:52:30,479
quite a lot. But there's a lot more X's

5584
02:52:30,479 --> 02:52:31,760
going on here. There's 10 different rows

5585
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:33,840
of them. Now I've used the wrong colors,

5586
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:35,840
but you get what I mean. If I'm sending

5587
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:37,600
cold email and I have a list of 100

5588
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:39,840
people and 100 business owners that I'm

5589
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:41,520
trying to contact and I send out the

5590
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:46,399
cold emails, there's only 16 people on

5591
02:52:46,399 --> 02:52:48,240
that list who are even moderate like

5592
02:52:48,240 --> 02:52:51,200
even open to buying and and use adopting

5593
02:52:51,200 --> 02:52:52,720
this technology. And that's that's

5594
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:54,800
pretty optimistic. There might be none.

5595
02:52:54,800 --> 02:52:56,560
I mean, this is if you get if you get a

5596
02:52:56,560 --> 02:52:58,399
perfect slice and segment of the

5597
02:52:58,399 --> 02:53:00,960
population, you'll get this 16 people

5598
02:53:00,960 --> 02:53:02,800
out of 100. You might get more, you

5599
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:03,840
might get less. Depends how you build

5600
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:05,600
your list. But if you're cold emailing,

5601
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:08,560
it's likely going to be this or less. So

5602
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:11,120
that means that you at a at a what a 80

5603
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:14,560
84% handicap. Where's my red? I need to

5604
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:16,359
use red on

5605
02:53:16,359 --> 02:53:18,920
this.

5606
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:21,920
84%

5607
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:25,680
handicap. So you when you're sending out

5608
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:26,960
the cold email, what's might be

5609
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:28,399
effective in other niches, not other

5610
02:53:28,399 --> 02:53:30,479
industries, we are at a massive handicap

5611
02:53:30,479 --> 02:53:31,520
here when you're trying to send this

5612
02:53:31,520 --> 02:53:36,080
stuff. Um, so keeping this in mind, the

5613
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:37,840
the real question should be, okay, if

5614
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:39,359
I'm trying if I don't have any proof and

5615
02:53:39,359 --> 02:53:41,359
I'm just starting my agency and I have

5616
02:53:41,359 --> 02:53:43,840
to be selling to this this early these

5617
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:46,240
early adopters and innovators, how can I

5618
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:47,680
get my message in front of as many of

5619
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:51,960
them as possible? All right, have a

5620
02:53:51,960 --> 02:53:55,439
think. Is it going to be I mean with

5621
02:53:55,439 --> 02:53:57,760
volume, if you send out huge amounts of

5622
02:53:57,760 --> 02:54:00,720
volume, you can negate this. You can if

5623
02:54:00,720 --> 02:54:02,160
you're only getting I don't know two

5624
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:03,279
people who are interested and then

5625
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:05,200
you're getting but then you even break

5626
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:07,439
this down even more. Say say you've got

5627
02:54:07,439 --> 02:54:08,800
this amount of people are interested and

5628
02:54:08,800 --> 02:54:13,040
you're getting only like a 5% 5% uh

5629
02:54:13,040 --> 02:54:14,520
positive reply

5630
02:54:14,520 --> 02:54:17,120
rate. There's still very small numbers

5631
02:54:17,120 --> 02:54:20,000
coming out of this cuz 5% of 16 what's

5632
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,640
that one point? It's like it's like one,

5633
02:54:22,640 --> 02:54:24,160
right? So there's not there's not much

5634
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:28,560
going on there. And if you have these

5635
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:30,479
kind of numbers, it's it's just like I'm

5636
02:54:30,479 --> 02:54:31,760
working against you really, which is

5637
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:32,960
what I'm trying I'm stumbling over words

5638
02:54:32,960 --> 02:54:34,880
a bit here, but I get I get anxious when

5639
02:54:34,880 --> 02:54:36,240
I have to do math on camera, by the way.

5640
02:54:36,240 --> 02:54:38,880
I'm not sure if you do too, but um 5% of

5641
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:40,600
16

5642
02:54:40,600 --> 02:54:43,439
1.6. So like.5% or something like that.

5643
02:54:43,439 --> 02:54:44,640
Maybe we fact check it on the screen,

5644
02:54:44,640 --> 02:54:47,040
but I'm not good at mental math on

5645
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:50,040
camera.

5646
02:54:55,240 --> 02:54:58,500
[Music]

5647
02:54:59,359 --> 02:55:01,200
Anyway, yes. So, I could have gone a

5648
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:02,240
little bit deeper here just to explain

5649
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:03,600
this, so I thought I'd do it in the

5650
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:05,359
editing process. Now, um, if we were to

5651
02:55:05,359 --> 02:55:07,520
get a 5% positive reply rate and we had

5652
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:09,920
a total of 100 people, cuz the whole box

5653
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:11,359
was filled with black X's and everyone

5654
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:13,040
was a potential customer, we'd be

5655
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:15,120
getting five replies out of 100, right?

5656
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:16,560
Um, what I was saying here is if we've

5657
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:18,560
only got 16 out of 100 cuz we're on the

5658
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:21,359
84% handicap, then only it ends up being

5659
02:55:21,359 --> 02:55:23,920
0.8 um, of a person. So that means

5660
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:25,840
there's one out of 16 is actually going

5661
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:27,359
to be a positive reply rate. Meaning

5662
02:55:27,359 --> 02:55:28,800
instead of getting five replies for

5663
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:30,640
sending 100 emails, you'll be getting

5664
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:32,800
one out of 100, which means then you add

5665
02:55:32,800 --> 02:55:34,479
that to the booking rate and the close

5666
02:55:34,479 --> 02:55:35,840
rate and you're basically getting no

5667
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:37,040
clients, right? So yeah, thought I'd

5668
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:38,000
just add that in there. Hope that's been

5669
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
helpful. So going back to what I was

5670
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,160
saying how if this is the handicap we

5671
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:43,319
have when we're doing outbound

5672
02:55:43,319 --> 02:55:46,319
communications the only other option is

5673
02:55:46,319 --> 02:55:48,399
well might be others but the only other

5674
02:55:48,399 --> 02:55:51,840
main option here is to try to get these

5675
02:55:51,840 --> 02:55:54,319
people via inbound lead generation

5676
02:55:54,319 --> 02:55:56,560
methods which essentially is instead of

5677
02:55:56,560 --> 02:55:58,560
me trying to reach out to the whole damn

5678
02:55:58,560 --> 02:56:00,640
world and and fighting against this

5679
02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:03,439
handicap of 84% or more I'm going to

5680
02:56:03,439 --> 02:56:06,479
instead try to attract these people to

5681
02:56:06,479 --> 02:56:07,800
my

5682
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:09,520
business and how are you going to

5683
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:12,560
attract them? Well, you can make content

5684
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:15,120
that appeals to those early adopters.

5685
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:19,200
So, in this case, running out of room

5686
02:56:19,319 --> 02:56:23,000
here. So, we have inbound

5687
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:26,479
inbound legion. So, trying to attract

5688
02:56:26,479 --> 02:56:28,560
the early adopters to your business is

5689
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:30,479
probably going to be and from the from

5690
02:56:30,479 --> 02:56:33,520
what I mean I'm an example of it.

5691
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:35,200
Morningside AI and everything that I

5692
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:36,720
have achieved and everything that I've

5693
02:56:36,720 --> 02:56:39,359
achieved the the small wins that I've

5694
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:40,960
achieved relative to other people in

5695
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:42,560
this in the in the world but within the

5696
02:56:42,560 --> 02:56:45,359
AI space I haven't done too damn bad. My

5697
02:56:45,359 --> 02:56:47,760
success has come from attracting early

5698
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:49,680
adopters and innovators to my business

5699
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:52,920
Morning Side via in lead

5700
02:56:52,920 --> 02:56:55,040
generation. So I'm just sharing what has

5701
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:56,399
worked for me and what I'm starting to

5702
02:56:56,399 --> 02:56:57,600
see. The reason I'm making this video is

5703
02:56:57,600 --> 02:56:58,720
because I'm starting to see an emerging

5704
02:56:58,720 --> 02:57:00,720
pattern within my community of more and

5705
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:02,720
more and more and more people using the

5706
02:57:02,720 --> 02:57:04,080
exact same strategy that I'm about to

5707
02:57:04,080 --> 02:57:06,880
tell you to generate those leads and get

5708
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:08,399
themselves out of just serving early

5709
02:57:08,399 --> 02:57:10,640
adopters, getting them the testimonials

5710
02:57:10,640 --> 02:57:12,240
and case studies they need so they can

5711
02:57:12,240 --> 02:57:14,560
start to tackle this early majority.

5712
02:57:14,560 --> 02:57:17,119
Inbound lead

5713
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:19,840
generation, LinkedIn, Twitter, I still

5714
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:21,359
call it Twitter X, whatever you want to

5715
02:57:21,359 --> 02:57:24,560
call it. YouTube, hell, maybe even you

5716
02:57:24,560 --> 02:57:26,080
start a Pinterest. Don't sign up on

5717
02:57:26,080 --> 02:57:28,800
Pinterest. I was just joking. LinkedIn,

5718
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:31,120
Twitter, and uh and YouTube are kind of

5719
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:32,560
the uh the go. You could do blog

5720
02:57:32,560 --> 02:57:35,120
posting, SEO, whatever you I just stick

5721
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:37,040
with these ones. But the thing is, you

5722
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:40,120
got to pick one and do it well. I, for

5723
02:57:40,120 --> 02:57:42,200
example, picked

5724
02:57:42,200 --> 02:57:45,040
YouTube and I think I did it moderately

5725
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:46,720
well. Um you guys can be the judge of

5726
02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:48,240
that. I guess it's the like and dislike

5727
02:57:48,240 --> 02:57:49,920
ratio on this video will determine if

5728
02:57:49,920 --> 02:57:51,840
I've done it well or not. But when it

5729
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:53,800
comes to money made from all of my

5730
02:57:53,800 --> 02:57:55,760
businesses, I'd say I've done pretty

5731
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:57,439
well on YouTube. And you can do the

5732
02:57:57,439 --> 02:58:00,080
same. But you got to pick one. And by

5733
02:58:00,080 --> 02:58:03,200
picking one, we get so many like I have

5734
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:04,880
never had to run any kind of advertising

5735
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:07,200
for Morningside. I've never had to run

5736
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:08,880
any kind of outbound communications. No

5737
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:10,160
LinkedIn outbound, no Instagram

5738
02:58:10,160 --> 02:58:12,479
outbound, no nothing. No cold email, no

5739
02:58:12,479 --> 02:58:13,840
nothing at Morningside. It all comes

5740
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:15,920
from my channel. And my channel is more

5741
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:17,600
so focused on helping you guys now to

5742
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:19,200
start your own agencies and sharing what

5743
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:20,880
we learn at Morningside. So, my content

5744
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:22,560
isn't even focused on selling to

5745
02:58:22,560 --> 02:58:23,760
businesses. Like, it's I'm not even

5746
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:25,279
trying to attract businesses to my

5747
02:58:25,279 --> 02:58:27,120
audience, but people are still seeing my

5748
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:28,800
videos who are business owners and

5749
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:30,240
coming to me to build their solutions.

5750
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:32,160
Inbound lead generation pretty good if

5751
02:58:32,160 --> 02:58:34,560
you do it right. So, what I'm seeing is

5752
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:36,560
a lot of success on LinkedIn at the

5753
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:38,960
moment. Uh LinkedIn is really hidden for

5754
02:58:38,960 --> 02:58:40,000
a lot of people in the community,

5755
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:41,359
particularly in my accelerator. I've had

5756
02:58:41,359 --> 02:58:43,040
some great uh success stories of people

5757
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:44,720
who we've just been on interview and

5758
02:58:44,720 --> 02:58:46,399
interview interview of people within my

5759
02:58:46,399 --> 02:58:48,319
accelerator and they all are using the

5760
02:58:48,319 --> 02:58:50,319
same LinkedIn strategy um which is to

5761
02:58:50,319 --> 02:58:53,439
generate inbound leads and okay so how

5762
02:58:53,439 --> 02:58:55,279
can you generate the inbound leads if

5763
02:58:55,279 --> 02:58:57,359
you were to take LinkedIn well what they

5764
02:58:57,359 --> 02:58:58,880
are all doing and I mean what I've done

5765
02:58:58,880 --> 02:59:00,880
as well on on YouTube it's not rocket

5766
02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:03,439
science but you need to somehow get

5767
02:59:03,439 --> 02:59:05,040
people on your LinkedIn so you need to

5768
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:06,479
gain connections you can just be

5769
02:59:06,479 --> 02:59:07,760
spamming out connections within your

5770
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:10,080
given niche just pick a niche start

5771
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:11,120
trying to connect with different people.

5772
02:59:11,120 --> 02:59:13,120
You will get a high acceptance rate of

5773
02:59:13,120 --> 02:59:14,479
connections. People just like, well,

5774
02:59:14,479 --> 02:59:16,080
yeah, sure, you can connect with me.

5775
02:59:16,080 --> 02:59:17,439
There's there's going to be enough

5776
02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:18,319
people that you can just start to

5777
02:59:18,319 --> 02:59:20,080
connect and build a bit of a base. And

5778
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:22,399
then you want to be creating I should do

5779
02:59:22,399 --> 02:59:26,600
it over here, right? So, you go build a

5780
02:59:26,600 --> 02:59:28,640
base or you might already have it

5781
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:29,680
already. A lot of the guys who are

5782
02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:31,120
succeeding quickly have already been

5783
02:59:31,120 --> 02:59:32,319
working in another job or another

5784
02:59:32,319 --> 02:59:34,080
industry and they're just starting to

5785
02:59:34,080 --> 02:59:35,760
convert their LinkedIn from their old

5786
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:38,000
career or their old persona into this

5787
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,080
new I'm an AI expert and I help build AI

5788
02:59:40,080 --> 02:59:41,600
solutions for this this doesn't even

5789
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:43,920
need to be niched niche down. You can

5790
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:45,439
stay general I build AI stuff and find

5791
02:59:45,439 --> 02:59:48,040
your niche later but getting a little

5792
02:59:48,040 --> 02:59:52,720
bit and then you need to post cool

5793
02:59:52,720 --> 02:59:55,120
valuable stuff and this way people will

5794
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:57,120
see that you know your stuff will know

5795
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:59,359
your [ __ ] uh is probably how I would

5796
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:01,279
have said it if I wasn't uh wasn't

5797
03:00:01,279 --> 03:00:03,439
limiting my vocabulary on here, but you

5798
03:00:03,439 --> 03:00:04,399
need to prove that you actually know

5799
03:00:04,399 --> 03:00:06,040
what you're talking about. And in this

5800
03:00:06,040 --> 03:00:08,319
way, by posting stuff regularly and

5801
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:09,920
sharing what you're doing as I have on

5802
03:00:09,920 --> 03:00:11,680
my channel, look at my past videos. You

5803
03:00:11,680 --> 03:00:13,920
can see from the start the entire

5804
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:16,080
character arc of my channel. The reason

5805
03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:17,680
I was able to do so well with Morning

5806
03:00:17,680 --> 03:00:19,040
Side and and we continue to do so is

5807
03:00:19,040 --> 03:00:20,560
because I built a base of proving that I

5808
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:23,399
knew my stuff. I was there giving coding

5809
03:00:23,399 --> 03:00:25,960
tutorials of stuff that I had personally

5810
03:00:25,960 --> 03:00:29,359
created and sharing it on my channel and

5811
03:00:29,359 --> 03:00:31,359
then I hired developers who are even

5812
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:33,200
better than me and now I get them on my

5813
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:34,720
second channel on my morning eye

5814
03:00:34,720 --> 03:00:36,080
channel. I bring my CTO Spencer. I

5815
03:00:36,080 --> 03:00:37,120
brought him on the channel the other

5816
03:00:37,120 --> 03:00:39,840
day. You need to be proving that either

5817
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:41,760
you have a competency or your team has a

5818
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:45,200
competency. Um anyway, I I'll leave that

5819
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:47,120
there cuz I don't want to don't want to

5820
03:00:47,120 --> 03:00:48,800
get a little bit a little bit too

5821
03:00:48,800 --> 03:00:49,920
sidetracked on that. That's probably

5822
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:51,359
talk for another video, but there's the

5823
03:00:51,359 --> 03:00:54,319
cliff notes of it. Um, the more

5824
03:00:54,319 --> 03:00:55,680
important thing that I want to talk

5825
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:58,240
about now is that there really is a a

5826
03:00:58,240 --> 03:01:02,080
race that is on. Um, the race is on for

5827
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:05,279
this early majority. And this is what

5828
03:01:05,279 --> 03:01:07,279
we've been we've kind of known it as

5829
03:01:07,279 --> 03:01:09,120
we've been early to this this space and

5830
03:01:09,120 --> 03:01:10,800
this AI agency opportunity that we've

5831
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:12,279
we've all hopped

5832
03:01:12,279 --> 03:01:15,040
on. But we're still in this this period

5833
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:16,800
of the AI space right now. We're we're

5834
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:20,080
in the the early stages, but we are

5835
03:01:20,080 --> 03:01:22,560
quickly moving into this early majority

5836
03:01:22,560 --> 03:01:24,720
and crossing the chasm where there's now

5837
03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:26,640
unlocking more and more people and in

5838
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:28,720
our case, more businesses who are

5839
03:01:28,720 --> 03:01:30,240
willing to buy our solutions. But

5840
03:01:30,240 --> 03:01:31,840
they're only willing to buy it if they

5841
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:33,840
have the proof, the evidence. They want

5842
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:35,920
to wait and see that the stuff really

5843
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:37,840
does what we say it does before they

5844
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:39,600
take they they take the red pull or the

5845
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:41,040
blue pull or whatever matrix analogy you

5846
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:42,640
want to use there. uh before they take

5847
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:44,160
the dive into using AI within their

5848
03:01:44,160 --> 03:01:46,319
business, they want to see the proof.

5849
03:01:46,319 --> 03:01:49,439
Now, for us, if you don't ever get past

5850
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:50,880
this early adopters phase and you don't

5851
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:52,479
follow one of these strategies to get

5852
03:01:52,479 --> 03:01:53,680
your first couple of clients and get

5853
03:01:53,680 --> 03:01:56,160
some evidence and get some proof, then

5854
03:01:56,160 --> 03:01:58,080
you'll never be able to come and compete

5855
03:01:58,080 --> 03:02:00,640
with myself and the other big dogs in

5856
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:02,240
the in the space. I just call myself a

5857
03:02:02,240 --> 03:02:04,000
big dog. That's so cringe. But, um the

5858
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:05,279
other people who are actually doing

5859
03:02:05,279 --> 03:02:06,720
numbers and selling these solutions

5860
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:08,720
successfully,

5861
03:02:08,720 --> 03:02:11,359
uh we're in here. Well, we can access

5862
03:02:11,359 --> 03:02:12,560
here. Like, there's still a lot of money

5863
03:02:12,560 --> 03:02:14,240
to be made with these early adopters and

5864
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:15,600
they're far easier to work with because

5865
03:02:15,600 --> 03:02:17,279
they're not really worried about they're

5866
03:02:17,279 --> 03:02:18,720
less pragmatic. They're not too worried

5867
03:02:18,720 --> 03:02:20,240
about the they're just excited. They're

5868
03:02:20,240 --> 03:02:21,920
not too worried about the effects while

5869
03:02:21,920 --> 03:02:23,359
they do want to see a bit of value. If

5870
03:02:23,359 --> 03:02:24,720
you're selling to these guys, you may

5871
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:26,399
notice that you build stuff that isn't

5872
03:02:26,399 --> 03:02:27,840
super valuable and they're still happy

5873
03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:29,439
with it cuz it's like, "Wow, that's

5874
03:02:29,439 --> 03:02:31,600
cool. My business has AI." Now, these

5875
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:33,279
guys can be lovely to work with. When we

5876
03:02:33,279 --> 03:02:34,960
get into here, they need a lot more

5877
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:38,399
evidence-based proof, etc.

5878
03:02:38,399 --> 03:02:39,800
But as this market

5879
03:02:39,800 --> 03:02:41,520
progresses, you're going to need to get

5880
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:42,720
into this point if you want to survive

5881
03:02:42,720 --> 03:02:43,840
and if you want to really make the big

5882
03:02:43,840 --> 03:02:46,160
bucks. So this is the current

5883
03:02:46,160 --> 03:02:47,840
competition within there's not much

5884
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:49,439
competition within the AI agency space

5885
03:02:49,439 --> 03:02:51,200
cuz there's not many of us. There's very

5886
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:52,399
very few of us who are actually on this

5887
03:02:52,399 --> 03:02:53,520
opportunity and trying to make money off

5888
03:02:53,520 --> 03:02:55,520
of it. And and the many few of us who

5889
03:02:55,520 --> 03:02:58,080
understand this and are doing it well

5890
03:02:58,080 --> 03:02:59,840
and and positioning their strategy in

5891
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:02,000
order to get this part done so that they

5892
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:03,439
can move into this early majority. So

5893
03:03:03,439 --> 03:03:04,399
there's not going to be many people

5894
03:03:04,399 --> 03:03:05,840
after this video maybe a bit more.

5895
03:03:05,840 --> 03:03:07,040
there's not going to be many people who

5896
03:03:07,040 --> 03:03:09,040
are in here competing for the big bucks

5897
03:03:09,040 --> 03:03:10,880
really. So that's my challenge to you

5898
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:14,200
all is that you need to use a strategy

5899
03:03:14,200 --> 03:03:17,520
that factors in this dynamic within the

5900
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:20,880
market that very few people 16% or

5901
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:22,800
thereabouts are actually interested in

5902
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:24,560
implementing the stuff at the moment if

5903
03:03:24,560 --> 03:03:27,359
you don't have any evidence or proof.

5904
03:03:27,359 --> 03:03:29,040
And the thing is if you're trying to get

5905
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:30,880
your offer or get your business and your

5906
03:03:30,880 --> 03:03:32,800
services in front of people, you don't

5907
03:03:32,800 --> 03:03:34,080
want to get it in front of these guys.

5908
03:03:34,080 --> 03:03:36,160
Listen, you're wasting your time. Get it

5909
03:03:36,160 --> 03:03:38,000
in front of these people. And the most

5910
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:39,680
effective way to do that is to attract

5911
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:41,680
them to you instead of bashing on their

5912
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:42,880
door and saying, "Do you want to buy

5913
03:03:42,880 --> 03:03:46,160
some AI stuff yet?" Just attract them to

5914
03:03:46,160 --> 03:03:49,359
yourself and let them self- select. If

5915
03:03:49,359 --> 03:03:51,200
you are connecting with people on

5916
03:03:51,200 --> 03:03:52,880
LinkedIn and they see you're an AI guy,

5917
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:55,680
I do AI for dental. I do AI for

5918
03:03:55,680 --> 03:03:58,000
financial services. Whatever it is, if

5919
03:03:58,000 --> 03:03:59,279
they see that and are interested,

5920
03:03:59,279 --> 03:04:01,439
they'll self- select and say, "Cool,

5921
03:04:01,439 --> 03:04:03,439
I'll connect with this guy. He AI for

5922
03:04:03,439 --> 03:04:05,040
financial services sounds interesting.

5923
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:06,160
I'm going to connect and add it. And

5924
03:04:06,160 --> 03:04:08,000
then you build your base on LinkedIn and

5925
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:09,520
you start building cool stuff. And while

5926
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:11,200
you're burn building cool stuff, you're

5927
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:13,920
also learning. So you're you're making

5928
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:15,520
leaps and bounds in this thing. Every

5929
03:04:15,520 --> 03:04:16,640
time you learn something and post it,

5930
03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:17,680
you're not only learning, but you're

5931
03:04:17,680 --> 03:04:19,520
also getting the marketing material to

5932
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:21,200
continue to show your your expertise and

5933
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:23,000
and build trust with your audience as

5934
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,120
well. So yeah, I just thought I'd throw

5935
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:27,760
down the gauntlet there and let you guys

5936
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:30,160
know that this is the challenge within

5937
03:04:30,160 --> 03:04:32,399
AI agency space right now.

5938
03:04:32,399 --> 03:04:34,800
We are all brothers and sisters in this

5939
03:04:34,800 --> 03:04:37,279
space which okay let's there's plenty

5940
03:04:37,279 --> 03:04:39,920
plenty to eat for everyone. Let's deal

5941
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:41,200
with this. Let's all start creating

5942
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:43,120
content. Let's make a personal brand.

5943
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:44,560
Let's get out there and start engaging

5944
03:04:44,560 --> 03:04:46,399
with people and building connections so

5945
03:04:46,399 --> 03:04:48,640
that you can start to make money and get

5946
03:04:48,640 --> 03:04:50,080
your start in this because I'm telling

5947
03:04:50,080 --> 03:04:53,279
you if you dillydattle around dillyd is

5948
03:04:53,279 --> 03:04:55,279
that a word? Anyway, you get what I

5949
03:04:55,279 --> 03:04:57,040
mean. If you mess around in this stage

5950
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:58,560
where we are here and we're very quickly

5951
03:04:58,560 --> 03:04:59,920
jumping over to this as I'll talk about

5952
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:01,439
a little bit later. But if you are

5953
03:05:01,439 --> 03:05:04,240
messing around, then you're not going to

5954
03:05:04,240 --> 03:05:06,000
when the when everyone else mobs onto

5955
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,840
this this opportunity and they're coming

5956
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:09,279
very soon. I'd say in the next next

5957
03:05:09,279 --> 03:05:10,560
year, I mean, we're already starting to

5958
03:05:10,560 --> 03:05:12,160
see other people selling these courses

5959
03:05:12,160 --> 03:05:14,000
and and things like this and trying to

5960
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:15,680
trying to say that they know what

5961
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:16,479
they're talking about in this. And

5962
03:05:16,479 --> 03:05:18,240
honestly, I've seen so many ads now,

5963
03:05:18,240 --> 03:05:19,760
it's kind of getting embarrassing what

5964
03:05:19,760 --> 03:05:21,200
these guys are trying to sell. So I

5965
03:05:21,200 --> 03:05:23,359
would say that not to not to big up what

5966
03:05:23,359 --> 03:05:25,760
I'm doing and my team and there's only a

5967
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:27,120
few people in the space who are who are

5968
03:05:27,120 --> 03:05:28,560
actually doing this thing and I I I tell

5969
03:05:28,560 --> 03:05:30,319
you like I am I am one of them and

5970
03:05:30,319 --> 03:05:31,840
there's a couple of other people who I

5971
03:05:31,840 --> 03:05:33,200
recommend on my channel and things like

5972
03:05:33,200 --> 03:05:35,359
this. So they are coming and it's

5973
03:05:35,359 --> 03:05:36,640
evident by the amount of other people

5974
03:05:36,640 --> 03:05:38,160
who are popping up and selling selling

5975
03:05:38,160 --> 03:05:39,600
how to do this thing. So that's the

5976
03:05:39,600 --> 03:05:41,359
that's the challenge. But if you delete

5977
03:05:41,359 --> 03:05:43,040
the other realm, other people are going

5978
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:44,880
to jump in here and but you're going to

5979
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:47,279
spend all this time trying to get get

5980
03:05:47,279 --> 03:05:48,880
yourself off the ground and then by the

5981
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:51,200
time you you get there, there's going to

5982
03:05:51,200 --> 03:05:53,279
be way way better way better agencies

5983
03:05:53,279 --> 03:05:54,640
who have just jumped in here and are

5984
03:05:54,640 --> 03:05:56,160
attacking this issue by because they

5985
03:05:56,160 --> 03:05:57,520
tried to solve these problems so that

5986
03:05:57,520 --> 03:06:00,319
they can attack this new market. So now

5987
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:02,000
I don't want to rub this off cuz it does

5988
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:05,279
look nice and pretty. Um, but I do want

5989
03:06:05,279 --> 03:06:08,399
to layer over something else here that's

5990
03:06:08,399 --> 03:06:09,880
also important

5991
03:06:09,880 --> 03:06:12,479
considering on this fine Saturday, we

5992
03:06:12,479 --> 03:06:14,560
just had a uh a pretty big update from

5993
03:06:14,560 --> 03:06:17,920
OpenAI, which I think uh highlights

5994
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:20,960
another uh another factor that gets

5995
03:06:20,960 --> 03:06:22,479
incorporated into this this whole

5996
03:06:22,479 --> 03:06:25,600
picture. So, um we just had um I'm going

5997
03:06:25,600 --> 03:06:28,800
to rub this off. We just had the

5998
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:30,040
assistance

5999
03:06:30,040 --> 03:06:34,560
API v2 release from OpenAI. And now this

6000
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:36,080
is a massive update. This is something

6001
03:06:36,080 --> 03:06:38,240
myself and the team at Morningside um

6002
03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:41,680
and and Agentive my my SAS platform we

6003
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:42,880
have been waiting for this. This was

6004
03:06:42,880 --> 03:06:46,240
really a bet that we made um 6 months

6005
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:49,040
ago now to say look the assistance API

6006
03:06:49,040 --> 03:06:51,359
is a ridiculously powerful platform. It

6007
03:06:51,359 --> 03:06:53,840
has custom knowledge agents. You can

6008
03:06:53,840 --> 03:06:55,760
connect tools. has does everything for

6009
03:06:55,760 --> 03:06:57,520
you. The chat history management, thread

6010
03:06:57,520 --> 03:06:59,920
management, tool calling, very powerful

6011
03:06:59,920 --> 03:07:01,920
package. But when it came out, it wasn't

6012
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:03,680
in a great state. Like it was very

6013
03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:06,319
ludicrously expensive, very slow,

6014
03:07:06,319 --> 03:07:08,000
knowledge base was very spotty. And so

6015
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,920
when we built a Gentive on top of it, we

6016
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:11,520
had to deal with customers who were very

6017
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:14,240
well users who were very unhappy with uh

6018
03:07:14,240 --> 03:07:16,800
the quality of of the the assistance API

6019
03:07:16,800 --> 03:07:17,840
that we were built on. But by

6020
03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:19,840
association, they think that our

6021
03:07:19,840 --> 03:07:21,439
knowledge base wasn't working. But in

6022
03:07:21,439 --> 03:07:22,960
reality, it was the assistance API

6023
03:07:22,960 --> 03:07:24,160
knowledge base that was not working. So

6024
03:07:24,160 --> 03:07:27,160
anyway, enough of me coping.

6025
03:07:27,160 --> 03:07:29,359
Um, what I was trying to say here is

6026
03:07:29,359 --> 03:07:32,000
that we have just

6027
03:07:32,680 --> 03:07:35,160
had assistance API

6028
03:07:35,160 --> 03:07:37,520
v2. Stick with me. This is going to sort

6029
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:38,920
of light the fire under your

6030
03:07:38,920 --> 03:07:42,760
bum. Now what also happens in

6031
03:07:42,760 --> 03:07:45,680
these is say using the web as an

6032
03:07:45,680 --> 03:07:50,399
example. This is like early 90s,

6033
03:07:51,080 --> 03:07:53,160
1990s,

6034
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:55,960
early

6035
03:07:55,960 --> 03:07:58,399
academics. So they you can plot out the

6036
03:07:58,399 --> 03:08:00,560
entire web adoption on this. You got the

6037
03:08:00,560 --> 03:08:02,000
academics early on who were like, "Wow,

6038
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
this internet's really cool. It really

6039
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:05,920
didn't work and it was terrible." Um,

6040
03:08:05,920 --> 03:08:07,600
but they believed in it and saw the saw

6041
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:09,200
the saw the potential. Then you had

6042
03:08:09,200 --> 03:08:10,640
people who came in in the sort of mid

6043
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:12,800
'90s, I'd say. And then they were able

6044
03:08:12,800 --> 03:08:14,720
to build companies on top of it. you got

6045
03:08:14,720 --> 03:08:17,200
the first couple kind of dot companies

6046
03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:18,479
and people were starting to be

6047
03:08:18,479 --> 03:08:20,240
visionaries visionaries and they were

6048
03:08:20,240 --> 03:08:22,640
taking the the technology and pushing it

6049
03:08:22,640 --> 03:08:24,479
to new limits and and finding real use

6050
03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:26,880
cases for it and these this is is where

6051
03:08:26,880 --> 03:08:28,479
we are right now with AI all of you

6052
03:08:28,479 --> 03:08:29,680
watching this are seeing the same thing

6053
03:08:29,680 --> 03:08:31,920
these voice agents chat agents u these

6054
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:33,439
automations and systems like these and

6055
03:08:33,439 --> 03:08:34,560
you're like wow there's so many use

6056
03:08:34,560 --> 03:08:38,000
cases for this uh but in order to get to

6057
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,800
the early majority when it came to the

6058
03:08:40,800 --> 03:08:44,080
web it needed faster like the

6059
03:08:44,080 --> 03:08:45,760
infrastructure and the technology itself

6060
03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:47,439
had to actually improve as well. So it

6061
03:08:47,439 --> 03:08:49,920
wasn't just ah yeah like people had to

6062
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:51,520
kind of push it down here just by doing

6063
03:08:51,520 --> 03:08:53,120
this businessy stuff with it. No, the

6064
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:55,040
technology that was underpinning it had

6065
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:56,960
to improve and the infrastructure that

6066
03:08:56,960 --> 03:08:58,560
allowed people to use it had to improve.

6067
03:08:58,560 --> 03:08:59,760
And what we are seeing why I'm saying

6068
03:08:59,760 --> 03:09:02,479
this is what we're seeing right now is

6069
03:09:02,479 --> 03:09:04,600
the assistance API update is

6070
03:09:04,600 --> 03:09:07,800
representative of this very move which

6071
03:09:07,800 --> 03:09:09,560
is my

6072
03:09:09,560 --> 03:09:13,040
my brain FM has started playing. Stop.

6073
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:15,600
got a ghost on the keys. In order for

6074
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:17,479
the web to progress into the early

6075
03:09:17,479 --> 03:09:22,560
majority, early match, they had to have

6076
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:24,560
improvements in the infrastructure. So

6077
03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:27,040
the the web was faster, the pages loaded

6078
03:09:27,040 --> 03:09:28,880
better, it looked prettier. Things that

6079
03:09:28,880 --> 03:09:31,040
took it from this this early on like

6080
03:09:31,040 --> 03:09:33,920
scientificy really nerdy academic thing.

6081
03:09:33,920 --> 03:09:35,359
It had to get to the point where these

6082
03:09:35,359 --> 03:09:36,960
early majority people were willing to

6083
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:38,720
adopt it cuz it made sense. It was

6084
03:09:38,720 --> 03:09:40,720
practical. These people, these

6085
03:09:40,720 --> 03:09:43,760
visionaries in the early '90s and DA

6086
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:45,680
innovators, they're not too concerned

6087
03:09:45,680 --> 03:09:47,920
about the practicality of these things.

6088
03:09:47,920 --> 03:09:50,160
They're more excited by it. But in order

6089
03:09:50,160 --> 03:09:51,520
to get to the early majority, we need

6090
03:09:51,520 --> 03:09:53,840
the infrastructure and the systems to

6091
03:09:53,840 --> 03:09:56,319
make this thing make sense. I will wait

6092
03:09:56,319 --> 03:09:59,040
and see until it makes sense. And what

6093
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:01,359
we have just been given a few days ago

6094
03:10:01,359 --> 03:10:07,000
is the update that makes it make sense.

6095
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:08,880
I will probably put a video out on this

6096
03:10:08,880 --> 03:10:12,080
in a bit. But the assistance API V2 is,

6097
03:10:12,080 --> 03:10:13,680
let me get red so you really get the

6098
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:17,319
message. Faster, more reliable. It is

6099
03:10:17,319 --> 03:10:20,720
also cheaper. So all of these things, if

6100
03:10:20,720 --> 03:10:22,399
you were selling these solutions via

6101
03:10:22,399 --> 03:10:23,760
Aentive or whatever you were selling,

6102
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:26,520
you'll understand that it was

6103
03:10:26,520 --> 03:10:29,520
slow. It was very slow. It was also

6104
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:33,359
extremely expensive in the V1.

6105
03:10:33,359 --> 03:10:35,439
And that's supposed to say reliable, not

6106
03:10:35,439 --> 03:10:37,359
relatable. But um it was not reliable.

6107
03:10:37,359 --> 03:10:39,520
The knowledge base kept kept going on

6108
03:10:39,520 --> 03:10:41,680
Smokco as I like to say and kind of

6109
03:10:41,680 --> 03:10:44,120
deciding that it wasn't working for that

6110
03:10:44,120 --> 03:10:46,680
afternoon. This is very

6111
03:10:46,680 --> 03:10:50,160
much early adopter behavior. So like I'm

6112
03:10:50,160 --> 03:10:52,560
okay with it being like this cuz I it's

6113
03:10:52,560 --> 03:10:54,319
still cool and I like it and I'm in this

6114
03:10:54,319 --> 03:10:56,080
bucket and I thought it was cool and I'm

6115
03:10:56,080 --> 03:10:57,200
sure you are too if you played around

6116
03:10:57,200 --> 03:10:59,760
with these GPTs and AI agents. But the

6117
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:02,479
assistance API v2 is a sort of coming of

6118
03:11:02,479 --> 03:11:05,240
age of this AI agent opportunity and

6119
03:11:05,240 --> 03:11:07,520
technology where it's going to start to

6120
03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:09,279
make sense for a lot more of the early

6121
03:11:09,279 --> 03:11:11,040
majority because it's faster it's

6122
03:11:11,040 --> 03:11:14,000
cheaper it's more reliable and they have

6123
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:17,080
waited and waited and seen waited and

6124
03:11:17,080 --> 03:11:19,600
saw you get what I mean they have waited

6125
03:11:19,600 --> 03:11:21,279
around for the time for this kind of

6126
03:11:21,279 --> 03:11:22,720
technology to get to the point now when

6127
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:23,920
we come to them and say hey look I can

6128
03:11:23,920 --> 03:11:25,359
build you an AI agent that does this or

6129
03:11:25,359 --> 03:11:27,520
this this and this okay well well how

6130
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:28,720
much is it going to cost me oh it's only

6131
03:11:28,720 --> 03:11:30,000
going cost you this, this, and this. We

6132
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:31,600
have techniques. We can fine-tune the

6133
03:11:31,600 --> 03:11:33,439
assistance API. We can actually do a

6134
03:11:33,439 --> 03:11:34,880
fine tuning. So, when we're testing it

6135
03:11:34,880 --> 03:11:37,200
initially, setting it up using GPT4. You

6136
03:11:37,200 --> 03:11:37,920
probably don't want to get that

6137
03:11:37,920 --> 03:11:38,880
technical when you're talking to

6138
03:11:38,880 --> 03:11:40,479
clients, but you can say, "Hey, look, we

6139
03:11:40,479 --> 03:11:42,319
can start it off, run some tests, get

6140
03:11:42,319 --> 03:11:43,680
all the get all the data back, and then

6141
03:11:43,680 --> 03:11:46,160
we can do a a sort of fine tuning of the

6142
03:11:46,160 --> 03:11:48,479
system down to your specific use case.

6143
03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:50,319
It's going to be cheaper, faster, um,

6144
03:11:50,319 --> 03:11:51,680
and it's going to be much more suitable

6145
03:11:51,680 --> 03:11:54,080
for your use case." So, thought I'd lay

6146
03:11:54,080 --> 03:11:56,479
that in there. There's also, how do I

6147
03:11:56,479 --> 03:11:57,920
how do I lay this in? Like I'm pretty

6148
03:11:57,920 --> 03:12:00,000
proud of that drawing. So I apologize

6149
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:01,680
for not rubbing it off and and giving

6150
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:03,439
you some new stuff, but I kind of want

6151
03:12:03,439 --> 03:12:04,560
to leave it up there for as long as

6152
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:07,479
possible. You can overlay the

6153
03:12:07,479 --> 03:12:11,000
curves. Let's say that this

6154
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:14,080
one is the technology itself. So let's

6155
03:12:14,080 --> 03:12:15,800
say this is the

6156
03:12:15,800 --> 03:12:18,560
tech. By tech, I mean the assistance API

6157
03:12:18,560 --> 03:12:19,760
for the web. It would mean like

6158
03:12:19,760 --> 03:12:22,640
broadband and and faster connections and

6159
03:12:22,640 --> 03:12:24,880
and better better browsers and things

6160
03:12:24,880 --> 03:12:28,479
like this. uh tech and then laid over

6161
03:12:28,479 --> 03:12:32,120
that you might have the actual

6162
03:12:32,120 --> 03:12:34,479
adoption. So you might have the adoption

6163
03:12:34,479 --> 03:12:38,240
which is like

6164
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:42,120
oh and this is the

6165
03:12:42,120 --> 03:12:44,840
actual

6166
03:12:44,840 --> 03:12:48,720
adoption. So it lags behind the tech.

6167
03:12:48,720 --> 03:12:52,000
We've just had new tech and we continue

6168
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:56,479
to see new tech, bland conversational

6169
03:12:57,880 --> 03:13:00,240
pathways. Check out bland conversational

6170
03:13:00,240 --> 03:13:02,000
pathways. Check out this is the voice

6171
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:03,359
agent equivalent essentially of the

6172
03:13:03,359 --> 03:13:05,120
assistance API. Wouldn't say equivalent,

6173
03:13:05,120 --> 03:13:07,040
I'd say the level of of complexity and

6174
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:08,640
polish on things like bland

6175
03:13:08,640 --> 03:13:10,960
conversational pathways as a solution

6176
03:13:10,960 --> 03:13:14,240
type of AI voice agents. We're seeing

6177
03:13:14,240 --> 03:13:15,920
this coming of age of the technology

6178
03:13:15,920 --> 03:13:17,680
beyond just what we're used to. I mean,

6179
03:13:17,680 --> 03:13:20,160
when I started doing this stuff and you

6180
03:13:20,160 --> 03:13:21,279
go back and look at some of my videos

6181
03:13:21,279 --> 03:13:23,840
when I was in my other apartment in

6182
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:26,319
Dubai and I was making these tutorials

6183
03:13:26,319 --> 03:13:28,800
for people, I was having to create

6184
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:31,520
custom mod chatbts with custom code and

6185
03:13:31,520 --> 03:13:33,200
all these difficult things and it would

6186
03:13:33,200 --> 03:13:34,880
barely even work. Often times it

6187
03:13:34,880 --> 03:13:36,880
wouldn't work. We struggled to deliver a

6188
03:13:36,880 --> 03:13:38,479
custom mod chatbot for months at

6189
03:13:38,479 --> 03:13:40,239
morning. That was the level of the tech

6190
03:13:40,239 --> 03:13:42,720
and now it's can take you probably 30

6191
03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:44,960
minutes or 10 minutes to create. We are

6192
03:13:44,960 --> 03:13:46,800
seeing leaps and bounds and the

6193
03:13:46,800 --> 03:13:49,760
technology is maturing. But that means

6194
03:13:49,760 --> 03:13:52,160
there's this actual adoption lagging

6195
03:13:52,160 --> 03:13:55,279
behind which is going to quickly Oh. Oh,

6196
03:13:55,279 --> 03:13:57,680
look. This is just the uh chef's kiss on

6197
03:13:57,680 --> 03:13:59,840
this graph if I can do it right. Um,

6198
03:13:59,840 --> 03:14:01,359
where's my black? This is taking me back

6199
03:14:01,359 --> 03:14:03,920
to doing like economics in high school.

6200
03:14:03,920 --> 03:14:07,520
Oh, we see a shift in the curve to the

6201
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:10,880
right. So this actual adoption curve is

6202
03:14:10,880 --> 03:14:14,560
going to catch up to technology itself.

6203
03:14:14,560 --> 03:14:18,279
And it is our job and this is where we

6204
03:14:18,279 --> 03:14:20,359
make the

6205
03:14:20,359 --> 03:14:22,920
mali. This is our

6206
03:14:22,920 --> 03:14:26,920
opportunity. The mali is in this

6207
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:29,600
shift. All right. I can give you a

6208
03:14:29,600 --> 03:14:31,239
second just to absorb

6209
03:14:31,239 --> 03:14:34,399
that. We have new technology coming of

6210
03:14:34,399 --> 03:14:36,720
age that it makes sense for the early

6211
03:14:36,720 --> 03:14:38,319
majority.

6212
03:14:38,319 --> 03:14:41,920
All you need to do is facilitate this

6213
03:14:41,920 --> 03:14:44,080
shift which is the entire thing that

6214
03:14:44,080 --> 03:14:46,080
this opportunity when I start first

6215
03:14:46,080 --> 03:14:47,359
started talking about it was

6216
03:14:47,359 --> 03:14:48,880
facilitating the adoption of new

6217
03:14:48,880 --> 03:14:50,880
technology. Now we have the new

6218
03:14:50,880 --> 03:14:52,960
technology the new new technology which

6219
03:14:52,960 --> 03:14:54,560
is much better and makes sense for the

6220
03:14:54,560 --> 03:14:56,720
early majority. So this is more so for

6221
03:14:56,720 --> 03:15:00,399
urgency a big kick up the butt for you

6222
03:15:00,399 --> 03:15:03,279
that this is we're we're moving. So, if

6223
03:15:03,279 --> 03:15:05,520
you don't quickly get this under control

6224
03:15:05,520 --> 03:15:07,439
and get some inbound leads and start to

6225
03:15:07,439 --> 03:15:09,359
close these early majority of these

6226
03:15:09,359 --> 03:15:12,160
these early adopters, you're going to

6227
03:15:12,160 --> 03:15:14,720
have issues because we're going to be

6228
03:15:14,720 --> 03:15:15,920
selling to these and and most of these

6229
03:15:15,920 --> 03:15:16,960
guys are going to have their things

6230
03:15:16,960 --> 03:15:18,720
built. A lot of the needs of these

6231
03:15:18,720 --> 03:15:20,399
people are going to be snapped up or

6232
03:15:20,399 --> 03:15:21,680
they're going to be even worse. They'll

6233
03:15:21,680 --> 03:15:23,279
be psychologically conditioned to

6234
03:15:23,279 --> 03:15:24,960
working with agencies who haven't worked

6235
03:15:24,960 --> 03:15:26,239
well in the past. This is what you see

6236
03:15:26,239 --> 03:15:28,080
in the SMMA markets and things like this

6237
03:15:28,080 --> 03:15:29,439
where there's so many agencies trying to

6238
03:15:29,439 --> 03:15:31,920
sell so many services that segments of

6239
03:15:31,920 --> 03:15:34,000
the of the different niches and stuff

6240
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:35,600
can get fatigued because there's so many

6241
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:37,760
bad actors not technically they are bad

6242
03:15:37,760 --> 03:15:39,040
actors but people who are selling

6243
03:15:39,040 --> 03:15:40,560
solutions who don't know what they're

6244
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:42,160
doing and aren't able they just take the

6245
03:15:42,160 --> 03:15:44,000
money deliver bad service and there's a

6246
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:45,840
skepticism towards new new solutions

6247
03:15:45,840 --> 03:15:48,399
providers. So these guys are still they

6248
03:15:48,399 --> 03:15:50,640
haven't been screwed over yet or it's

6249
03:15:50,640 --> 03:15:52,399
highly likely they haven't. So you need

6250
03:15:52,399 --> 03:15:53,960
to move

6251
03:15:53,960 --> 03:15:56,960
fast. Start a personal brand. Start

6252
03:15:56,960 --> 03:15:58,479
talking and sharing about what you're

6253
03:15:58,479 --> 03:16:01,040
doing. Learn and document the process so

6254
03:16:01,040 --> 03:16:02,640
that you can and have some kind of

6255
03:16:02,640 --> 03:16:04,640
strategy. Right? So you may be thinking

6256
03:16:04,640 --> 03:16:06,479
this doesn't make sense, but any of

6257
03:16:06,479 --> 03:16:08,479
these posting regularly as long as you

6258
03:16:08,479 --> 03:16:11,040
have some kind of growth strategy which

6259
03:16:11,040 --> 03:16:13,680
any of you have, you all have fingers.

6260
03:16:13,680 --> 03:16:15,840
You can all search up on the internet

6261
03:16:15,840 --> 03:16:18,479
how to grow a LinkedIn, how to grow on

6262
03:16:18,479 --> 03:16:21,279
Twitter. The information is there. You

6263
03:16:21,279 --> 03:16:23,120
just needed the strategy. And I've given

6264
03:16:23,120 --> 03:16:26,399
you the strategy. You use one of these.

6265
03:16:26,399 --> 03:16:28,640
You learn on the job. You share what you

6266
03:16:28,640 --> 03:16:31,680
learn. You hire these PE. You close

6267
03:16:31,680 --> 03:16:32,920
these kind of

6268
03:16:32,920 --> 03:16:35,200
clients. And that will set you up with

6269
03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:37,040
the evidence in order to tackle this.

6270
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:38,239
Now, you can continue to serve these

6271
03:16:38,239 --> 03:16:40,399
clients cuz they're usually a lot nicer

6272
03:16:40,399 --> 03:16:43,120
cuz I don't require this pragmatic angle

6273
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:46,080
on it. But when the opportunity comes,

6274
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:48,319
when this pool starts to be tapped out

6275
03:16:48,319 --> 03:16:50,000
and when there's bigger money to be made

6276
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:51,920
here, you are going to have the skills,

6277
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:54,239
resources, and testimonial and proof to

6278
03:16:54,239 --> 03:16:55,439
start to do it. If you don't understand

6279
03:16:55,439 --> 03:16:57,040
these different segments, then you're

6280
03:16:57,040 --> 03:16:58,239
going to be doing using the wrong

6281
03:16:58,239 --> 03:16:59,840
strategy at the wrong time. But when we

6282
03:16:59,840 --> 03:17:04,080
do start to see this this pool open up,

6283
03:17:04,080 --> 03:17:06,000
that's when you can do the cold email.

6284
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:08,399
You can still do the cold email. Now, as

6285
03:17:08,399 --> 03:17:10,640
you give it a year or two, this opens up

6286
03:17:10,640 --> 03:17:12,319
and now these 50% of the population who

6287
03:17:12,319 --> 03:17:14,000
are like, "Hell yeah, like I'll get some

6288
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:17,279
AI in my business, then you can start to

6289
03:17:17,279 --> 03:17:19,760
do those cold those outbound systems. Or

6290
03:17:19,760 --> 03:17:21,920
better yet, you can start to even do it

6291
03:17:21,920 --> 03:17:24,080
once you have the proof. You can just

6292
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:25,439
start setting them up because you need

6293
03:17:25,439 --> 03:17:26,800
to you can't just write a cold email and

6294
03:17:26,800 --> 03:17:28,640
say, "Hey, I can build your chat. What

6295
03:17:28,640 --> 03:17:29,840
do you want it?" He's like, "What does

6296
03:17:29,840 --> 03:17:31,439
it do for me? How much does it cost? Is

6297
03:17:31,439 --> 03:17:32,880
there going to be any like what if it

6298
03:17:32,880 --> 03:17:34,000
doesn't work? Are you going to waste my

6299
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:35,600
time?" there's pragmatic reasons that

6300
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:37,040
you need to answer and objections that

6301
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:38,319
you need to handle. So, if you can have

6302
03:17:38,319 --> 03:17:39,920
the testimonials and case studies in

6303
03:17:39,920 --> 03:17:41,840
your camera and the outbound um but it

6304
03:17:41,840 --> 03:17:42,880
will take a lot more to get through to

6305
03:17:42,880 --> 03:17:43,920
them and a lot more proof. But yeah,

6306
03:17:43,920 --> 03:17:46,319
that's uh that was cool. I hope you guys

6307
03:17:46,319 --> 03:17:49,359
enjoyed and I hope that was

6308
03:17:50,439 --> 03:17:52,399
valuable. You guys really seem to like

6309
03:17:52,399 --> 03:17:54,000
the video I put out recently on five

6310
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:55,840
different ways to start an AI agency in

6311
03:17:55,840 --> 03:17:57,760
2024. Um, and that was more on the

6312
03:17:57,760 --> 03:17:59,359
technical expertise side and how you can

6313
03:17:59,359 --> 03:18:01,040
get your foot in the door to actually

6314
03:18:01,040 --> 03:18:02,479
learn the skills required to start one

6315
03:18:02,479 --> 03:18:03,840
of these agencies and get the AI

6316
03:18:03,840 --> 03:18:06,399
expertise part of your business. So, if

6317
03:18:06,399 --> 03:18:07,600
you remember in that video, there's

6318
03:18:07,600 --> 03:18:09,359
three problems or or three key hurdles

6319
03:18:09,359 --> 03:18:10,960
that you need to get over when you're

6320
03:18:10,960 --> 03:18:12,160
starting one of these businesses. The

6321
03:18:12,160 --> 03:18:13,600
first one is some kind of technical

6322
03:18:13,600 --> 03:18:16,160
expertise and actual understanding of

6323
03:18:16,160 --> 03:18:17,680
how AI can help businesses. And that's

6324
03:18:17,680 --> 03:18:19,120
familiarity with the tools. It's

6325
03:18:19,120 --> 03:18:20,960
experience in in building solutions and

6326
03:18:20,960 --> 03:18:22,399
playing around with them yourself. And

6327
03:18:22,399 --> 03:18:24,080
then the second problem is the lead

6328
03:18:24,080 --> 03:18:25,120
flow. How are you going to actually

6329
03:18:25,120 --> 03:18:26,399
generate leads and get people to come

6330
03:18:26,399 --> 03:18:28,000
and contact you about building things

6331
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:29,520
for them? And finally, the third problem

6332
03:18:29,520 --> 03:18:31,279
is authority and credibility needed to

6333
03:18:31,279 --> 03:18:32,720
actually close those deals to prove to

6334
03:18:32,720 --> 03:18:34,319
these business owners that you are the

6335
03:18:34,319 --> 03:18:35,840
person for the job and they can entrust

6336
03:18:35,840 --> 03:18:37,439
you with their money to actually give

6337
03:18:37,439 --> 03:18:38,640
them the results they require. So, what

6338
03:18:38,640 --> 03:18:39,920
I'm going to do in this video is rip

6339
03:18:39,920 --> 03:18:41,520
through these 23 methods very quickly.

6340
03:18:41,520 --> 03:18:42,640
I'm not going to be giving you super

6341
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:44,160
in-depth information, just a highle

6342
03:18:44,160 --> 03:18:45,600
overview of what the lead generation

6343
03:18:45,600 --> 03:18:47,439
method is and who's used it in my

6344
03:18:47,439 --> 03:18:48,720
community, etc., where I'm getting this

6345
03:18:48,720 --> 03:18:50,720
information from. And then from there on

6346
03:18:50,720 --> 03:18:52,399
my free school community, same deal as

6347
03:18:52,399 --> 03:18:54,160
the last video. um it's going to be all

6348
03:18:54,160 --> 03:18:55,520
the information on each of them. So say

6349
03:18:55,520 --> 03:18:57,920
if we have 1 2 3 under each of those on

6350
03:18:57,920 --> 03:18:59,040
the school community is going to be

6351
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:01,359
resources and free resources that I can

6352
03:19:01,359 --> 03:19:03,200
point you to on YouTube elsewhere that

6353
03:19:03,200 --> 03:19:04,720
you can then go and explore that lead

6354
03:19:04,720 --> 03:19:06,319
generation method further. So keep that

6355
03:19:06,319 --> 03:19:07,600
in mind as you're watching this. Each of

6356
03:19:07,600 --> 03:19:08,800
these methods is going to have more

6357
03:19:08,800 --> 03:19:10,080
information if you are interested in

6358
03:19:10,080 --> 03:19:11,760
pursuing that further on the school

6359
03:19:11,760 --> 03:19:14,000
community. Now, uh, jumping into things,

6360
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:15,720
let's get started. As a

6361
03:19:15,720 --> 03:19:17,920
disclaimer, before you go into this, I

6362
03:19:17,920 --> 03:19:19,600
don't want you sitting there and making

6363
03:19:19,600 --> 03:19:21,680
a big list of 10 different ways or 10

6364
03:19:21,680 --> 03:19:23,760
different examples or methods that I'm

6365
03:19:23,760 --> 03:19:24,960
going to cover here and thinking you're

6366
03:19:24,960 --> 03:19:26,239
going to do all of them. The worst thing

6367
03:19:26,239 --> 03:19:28,239
you could do is to try to do too much at

6368
03:19:28,239 --> 03:19:29,840
once. If you're just getting started, I

6369
03:19:29,840 --> 03:19:31,840
like the Hazi analogy of taking some

6370
03:19:31,840 --> 03:19:33,200
weight off the bar. When we are starting

6371
03:19:33,200 --> 03:19:34,800
as entrepreneurs, we like to think we're

6372
03:19:34,800 --> 03:19:36,000
really strong and put a lot of weight on

6373
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:37,200
the bar and think that we can do very

6374
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:38,640
complex things. So, I want to make it

6375
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:40,000
clear that all you need to do is pick

6376
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:42,160
one of these and do it well and you will

6377
03:19:42,160 --> 03:19:43,439
get your agency off the ground.

6378
03:19:43,439 --> 03:19:45,120
Personally, for me to grow Morningside

6379
03:19:45,120 --> 03:19:47,520
AI, my agency into what it is now. We

6380
03:19:47,520 --> 03:19:48,960
have only had to use one of them and

6381
03:19:48,960 --> 03:19:50,880
that was YouTube. So, there's your

6382
03:19:50,880 --> 03:19:52,479
disclaimer. There's the note. You don't

6383
03:19:52,479 --> 03:19:53,840
need to do too much. Doing too much will

6384
03:19:53,840 --> 03:19:56,000
actually be detrimental to your success.

6385
03:19:56,000 --> 03:20:00,720
So, 23 methods client acquisition.

6386
03:20:00,720 --> 03:20:03,680
Number one is Fiverr. So with Fiverr,

6387
03:20:03,680 --> 03:20:05,120
you may have negative connotations

6388
03:20:05,120 --> 03:20:08,000
towards it being a $5 cheap platform,

6389
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:09,520
but in fact, this is where a lot of

6390
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:10,800
people and a lot of business owners go

6391
03:20:10,800 --> 03:20:12,080
and they don't know where to look. So

6392
03:20:12,080 --> 03:20:13,600
they'll go into Fiverr, they'll go onto

6393
03:20:13,600 --> 03:20:16,239
the next one, which is Upwork, and they

6394
03:20:16,239 --> 03:20:17,600
try to find some professionals who are

6395
03:20:17,600 --> 03:20:19,359
on there and offering services in the AI

6396
03:20:19,359 --> 03:20:20,960
space. The Fiverr and Upwork methods do

6397
03:20:20,960 --> 03:20:22,479
work extremely well if you're willing to

6398
03:20:22,479 --> 03:20:23,680
put in the effort on the platform. If

6399
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:25,040
you just treat it as another throwaway

6400
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:26,399
part of your business, you're not giving

6401
03:20:26,399 --> 03:20:27,920
it all of your attention, you're never

6402
03:20:27,920 --> 03:20:30,080
going to reach the higher earnings on

6403
03:20:30,080 --> 03:20:31,520
the platform and also the reviews and

6404
03:20:31,520 --> 03:20:32,720
ratings that you need to get that

6405
03:20:32,720 --> 03:20:34,239
authority and credibility to close the

6406
03:20:34,239 --> 03:20:35,120
deals. Right? Remember the three

6407
03:20:35,120 --> 03:20:36,960
problems, technical expertise, lead

6408
03:20:36,960 --> 03:20:38,800
flow, and authority and credibility.

6409
03:20:38,800 --> 03:20:40,000
These will give you the lead flow

6410
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:41,439
because you can position yourself on

6411
03:20:41,439 --> 03:20:44,080
them as I I've built XYZ or I can do

6412
03:20:44,080 --> 03:20:45,520
this for you. And then if you've got the

6413
03:20:45,520 --> 03:20:47,040
reviews to back it up over time, you're

6414
03:20:47,040 --> 03:20:47,920
going to have the authority and

6415
03:20:47,920 --> 03:20:49,200
credibility that'll get those deals over

6416
03:20:49,200 --> 03:20:52,160
the line. So Fiverr, um Mark, a member

6417
03:20:52,160 --> 03:20:53,439
of our community, one of the top guys in

6418
03:20:53,439 --> 03:20:54,720
my accelerator. If you haven't watched

6419
03:20:54,720 --> 03:20:56,319
my interview with him from last year,

6420
03:20:56,319 --> 03:20:57,920
that'll be up here. But Mark is

6421
03:20:57,920 --> 03:20:59,520
absolutely crushing it. He is top rated

6422
03:20:59,520 --> 03:21:01,600
on Fiverr. So he is like the number one

6423
03:21:01,600 --> 03:21:03,439
AI guy on Fiverr right now. And he ranks

6424
03:21:03,439 --> 03:21:04,800
at the top. Anytime you search anything

6425
03:21:04,800 --> 03:21:06,560
AR related, Mark is right at the top

6426
03:21:06,560 --> 03:21:07,840
there. And you can actually run ads to

6427
03:21:07,840 --> 03:21:08,720
make sure that you get done with

6428
03:21:08,720 --> 03:21:09,840
placements and stuff like this. So

6429
03:21:09,840 --> 03:21:14,479
Fiverr and Upwork, um Mark, uh I will

6430
03:21:14,479 --> 03:21:15,920
have resources and links to Mark's

6431
03:21:15,920 --> 03:21:17,120
channels, etc. because he's got some

6432
03:21:17,120 --> 03:21:18,479
videos on Fiverr. it'll all be on the

6433
03:21:18,479 --> 03:21:20,000
school community. So these are the same

6434
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:21,359
deal. Upwork and Fiverr allow you to

6435
03:21:21,359 --> 03:21:22,880
list yourself on a platform and be

6436
03:21:22,880 --> 03:21:24,880
discovered by business owners. Thirdly,

6437
03:21:24,880 --> 03:21:26,640
we have referrals. Now, these are not

6438
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:28,239
necessarily how to get your first client

6439
03:21:28,239 --> 03:21:30,000
methods. These are just general client

6440
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:31,920
acquisition methods. So referrals after

6441
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:33,600
you've done a couple jobs on Fiverr and

6442
03:21:33,600 --> 03:21:35,120
Upwork, you can then go ask the people

6443
03:21:35,120 --> 03:21:36,880
that you've worked with for referrals

6444
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:38,000
for other people that have similar

6445
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:39,279
business and similar problems to them.

6446
03:21:39,279 --> 03:21:41,120
So referrals something that a lot of the

6447
03:21:41,120 --> 03:21:43,120
time businesses forget to do and you

6448
03:21:43,120 --> 03:21:44,239
need to build it in as part of the

6449
03:21:44,239 --> 03:21:46,319
system to your business. Okay, after XYZ

6450
03:21:46,319 --> 03:21:47,840
number of days when they go and ask or

6451
03:21:47,840 --> 03:21:50,080
on the on the offboarding or or like end

6452
03:21:50,080 --> 03:21:51,920
of client call, we need to ask or

6453
03:21:51,920 --> 03:21:53,279
request for this. If you do it every

6454
03:21:53,279 --> 03:21:54,560
time you finish a client project

6455
03:21:54,560 --> 03:21:56,319
successfully, you are going to get some

6456
03:21:56,319 --> 03:21:58,160
clients from referrals, which is just

6457
03:21:58,160 --> 03:21:59,600
free acquisition basically. And it's

6458
03:21:59,600 --> 03:22:00,880
also coming through with a little bit

6459
03:22:00,880 --> 03:22:02,479
more authority and credibility when you

6460
03:22:02,479 --> 03:22:03,760
go to hop on those calls with those

6461
03:22:03,760 --> 03:22:04,880
referrals that you've been connected

6462
03:22:04,880 --> 03:22:06,319
with because that's come from someone

6463
03:22:06,319 --> 03:22:07,439
that they know and saying, "Hey, these

6464
03:22:07,439 --> 03:22:08,960
guys did a good job. They can help you

6465
03:22:08,960 --> 03:22:10,080
with this problem as well." So, you get

6466
03:22:10,080 --> 03:22:11,600
the authority and credibility and the

6467
03:22:11,600 --> 03:22:13,279
lead flow from this. Number four, we

6468
03:22:13,279 --> 03:22:17,840
have warm outreach or warm reachouts as

6469
03:22:17,840 --> 03:22:20,080
uh Mozy will say. So warm outreach or

6470
03:22:20,080 --> 03:22:22,160
warm reachouts is reaching out to people

6471
03:22:22,160 --> 03:22:23,359
that you already know who are in your

6472
03:22:23,359 --> 03:22:25,279
network. The Homozi strategy that he

6473
03:22:25,279 --> 03:22:27,680
detailed in $100 million leads is the

6474
03:22:27,680 --> 03:22:29,040
the gold standard here. I'm going to try

6475
03:22:29,040 --> 03:22:30,800
to tell you a better method. Um I will

6476
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:32,399
leave a link to that particular podcast.

6477
03:22:32,399 --> 03:22:33,760
You can get it for free. That'll be on

6478
03:22:33,760 --> 03:22:35,120
the school community as resources for

6479
03:22:35,120 --> 03:22:36,720
this as well. Basically, you can pull

6480
03:22:36,720 --> 03:22:38,000
all the the contacts that you have in

6481
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:39,600
your phone, your email, all your

6482
03:22:39,600 --> 03:22:40,880
followers, etc., And you can build a

6483
03:22:40,880 --> 03:22:42,239
list of people that you have warm reach

6484
03:22:42,239 --> 03:22:43,680
out capabilities to. And then you write

6485
03:22:43,680 --> 03:22:45,279
a message to reach out to them, offer

6486
03:22:45,279 --> 03:22:47,439
your services, or even ask them to refer

6487
03:22:47,439 --> 03:22:48,880
you to people who can. This is actually

6488
03:22:48,880 --> 03:22:50,720
by far the easiest way to get clients

6489
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:52,000
initially for anyone who's starting

6490
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:54,239
these businesses is to reach out to your

6491
03:22:54,239 --> 03:22:55,680
existing network. And many people

6492
03:22:55,680 --> 03:22:56,800
overlook this. And this is actually

6493
03:22:56,800 --> 03:22:58,080
something we're seeing a lot of success

6494
03:22:58,080 --> 03:22:59,760
with within my accelerator. And as soon

6495
03:22:59,760 --> 03:23:00,880
as people join the program, we tell

6496
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:02,000
them, okay, get straight into warm

6497
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:03,600
outreach. And they're signing one, two,

6498
03:23:03,600 --> 03:23:04,800
three clients within the first couple of

6499
03:23:04,800 --> 03:23:06,399
weeks as well. So warm outreach if

6500
03:23:06,399 --> 03:23:08,000
you're not doing it don't overlook it

6501
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:09,359
because it's a very easy way to get your

6502
03:23:09,359 --> 03:23:10,800
foot in the door and get started. Next

6503
03:23:10,800 --> 03:23:13,040
we have LinkedIn content and then

6504
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:14,720
similarly we have I'm going to keep the

6505
03:23:14,720 --> 03:23:18,040
separate LinkedIn uh

6506
03:23:18,040 --> 03:23:21,600
connect and DM. So LinkedIn content and

6507
03:23:21,600 --> 03:23:23,520
DM LinkedIn is by far one of the most

6508
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:25,120
effective platforms for getting leads

6509
03:23:25,120 --> 03:23:26,479
for your AI agency right now. People in

6510
03:23:26,479 --> 03:23:27,920
my accelerator are crushing it with some

6511
03:23:27,920 --> 03:23:29,359
of the stuff we put out there. Not to

6512
03:23:29,359 --> 03:23:30,479
just keep talking about that but that's

6513
03:23:30,479 --> 03:23:32,399
where I get most my information from.

6514
03:23:32,399 --> 03:23:33,920
LinkedIn absolutely smashing it. If

6515
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:35,520
you're able to post a valuable content

6516
03:23:35,520 --> 03:23:36,880
and then people are engaging with it,

6517
03:23:36,880 --> 03:23:38,399
they're liking it, they're leaving a

6518
03:23:38,399 --> 03:23:40,479
comment, etc., then you have the

6519
03:23:40,479 --> 03:23:42,640
justification to then go and uh shoot

6520
03:23:42,640 --> 03:23:44,319
them a DM and say, "Hey, look, saw that

6521
03:23:44,319 --> 03:23:45,760
you engaged in my post. I was wondering

6522
03:23:45,760 --> 03:23:47,200
if you have any other questions or I can

6523
03:23:47,200 --> 03:23:48,319
help you out in any other way." And you

6524
03:23:48,319 --> 03:23:49,680
start a conversation there and that can

6525
03:23:49,680 --> 03:23:51,520
lead to hopping on a discovery call.

6526
03:23:51,520 --> 03:23:54,160
This is a good way to attract if you I

6527
03:23:54,160 --> 03:23:55,680
mean I talk about it every video by now

6528
03:23:55,680 --> 03:23:57,520
but this technology adoption curve

6529
03:23:57,520 --> 03:23:59,200
you're going to attract those early

6530
03:23:59,200 --> 03:24:00,800
adopters who are easy clients to get

6531
03:24:00,800 --> 03:24:02,560
signed initially and by posting content

6532
03:24:02,560 --> 03:24:04,239
and letting them respond to it and say

6533
03:24:04,239 --> 03:24:06,000
hey I'm interested then you able to find

6534
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:07,439
those early adopters who are willing to

6535
03:24:07,439 --> 03:24:08,960
get AI built into their business right

6536
03:24:08,960 --> 03:24:10,960
now whereas the majority of the market

6537
03:24:10,960 --> 03:24:13,279
right now is not actually interested. So

6538
03:24:13,279 --> 03:24:15,040
LinkedIn content post valuable things

6539
03:24:15,040 --> 03:24:17,279
and DM people. Um and LinkedIn connect

6540
03:24:17,279 --> 03:24:18,880
and DM is a little bit different. We set

6541
03:24:18,880 --> 03:24:21,120
up an automation like on Dripify. Again,

6542
03:24:21,120 --> 03:24:22,560
I'll leave resources for all of these so

6543
03:24:22,560 --> 03:24:24,080
that you know how to set these campaigns

6544
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:25,840
up and set up these automations. But you

6545
03:24:25,840 --> 03:24:27,279
can use automations on LinkedIn to

6546
03:24:27,279 --> 03:24:28,880
automatically connect with people from a

6547
03:24:28,880 --> 03:24:30,960
given uh industry or niche. You can

6548
03:24:30,960 --> 03:24:34,080
filter by niche or industry and you're

6549
03:24:34,080 --> 03:24:35,600
able to connect with them automatically,

6550
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:37,200
send them a little message, etc. And

6551
03:24:37,200 --> 03:24:38,640
then you're able to shoot them a DM and

6552
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:40,479
a sequence of DMs and you can offer your

6553
03:24:40,479 --> 03:24:41,920
services that way. So this is more of an

6554
03:24:41,920 --> 03:24:44,239
automated way. This is a contentbased

6555
03:24:44,239 --> 03:24:45,439
way. You can automate this to some

6556
03:24:45,439 --> 03:24:47,840
degree if you have some fancy AI content

6557
03:24:47,840 --> 03:24:49,359
creation tools, but I'd recommend just

6558
03:24:49,359 --> 03:24:50,880
starting off manually writing it

6559
03:24:50,880 --> 03:24:52,479
initially. So, of course, you can do

6560
03:24:52,479 --> 03:24:54,560
both. And if you choose LinkedIn as as

6561
03:24:54,560 --> 03:24:56,720
your platform, you can stack these two,

6562
03:24:56,720 --> 03:24:58,000
and I would recommend that you do so you

6563
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:59,439
go all in on growing. So, you can use

6564
03:24:59,439 --> 03:25:00,880
the connect and DM automation. And

6565
03:25:00,880 --> 03:25:02,399
again, I'll I'll leave setup guides on

6566
03:25:02,399 --> 03:25:04,399
the on the school post. Um, you can use

6567
03:25:04,399 --> 03:25:05,840
this to add people to your audience, and

6568
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:07,120
then therefore more people are going to

6569
03:25:07,120 --> 03:25:08,319
see your content. You're going to get

6570
03:25:08,319 --> 03:25:09,600
more people out of here who've got a bit

6571
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:11,840
more trust, etc. So it is a is a

6572
03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:13,359
virtuous cycle where you're going to see

6573
03:25:13,359 --> 03:25:14,720
more and more results over time because

6574
03:25:14,720 --> 03:25:16,000
you keep adding more people to your

6575
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:17,520
connection request. So to your

6576
03:25:17,520 --> 03:25:19,920
connection sorry and one thing I'll

6577
03:25:19,920 --> 03:25:21,439
mention here is you are using an

6578
03:25:21,439 --> 03:25:23,359
automation um a friend of mine who is a

6579
03:25:23,359 --> 03:25:24,960
LinkedIn sales expert that's is the

6580
03:25:24,960 --> 03:25:26,560
whole thing he does he says if you are

6581
03:25:26,560 --> 03:25:28,080
sending a connection request don't

6582
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:29,920
include a message with the connection

6583
03:25:29,920 --> 03:25:32,399
request. If you send just a plain empty

6584
03:25:32,399 --> 03:25:33,920
connection request people assume that

6585
03:25:33,920 --> 03:25:35,120
you know them or it's just a friendly

6586
03:25:35,120 --> 03:25:36,880
thing and they'll accept it at a much

6587
03:25:36,880 --> 03:25:38,080
higher rate. I believe you said it's a

6588
03:25:38,080 --> 03:25:40,479
20 to 30% increase in acceptance rate of

6589
03:25:40,479 --> 03:25:41,840
the connection request if you don't

6590
03:25:41,840 --> 03:25:43,439
include anything in the connection

6591
03:25:43,439 --> 03:25:44,720
message because then they assume that

6592
03:25:44,720 --> 03:25:45,760
you're trying to sell them something. So

6593
03:25:45,760 --> 03:25:47,120
if you can leave it out and you're going

6594
03:25:47,120 --> 03:25:48,640
to see more connections and more people

6595
03:25:48,640 --> 03:25:51,680
added to your network. Now similarly we

6596
03:25:51,680 --> 03:25:55,760
have uh seven Twitter content Twitter X

6597
03:25:55,760 --> 03:25:58,920
whatever you want to say uh Twitter

6598
03:25:58,920 --> 03:26:02,399
content and then Twitter cold. So

6599
03:26:02,399 --> 03:26:04,560
similar to LinkedIn LinkedIn you can't

6600
03:26:04,560 --> 03:26:06,000
cold DM people. you need to be connected

6601
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:07,520
with them or some people you can message

6602
03:26:07,520 --> 03:26:09,439
if they choose to but in the majority of

6603
03:26:09,439 --> 03:26:10,880
cases you can't cold DM people on

6604
03:26:10,880 --> 03:26:12,399
Twitter it's much more likely that you

6605
03:26:12,399 --> 03:26:14,160
are able to send a cold DM to someone so

6606
03:26:14,160 --> 03:26:16,239
the cold DM strategy applies here and

6607
03:26:16,239 --> 03:26:17,439
then posting content on Twitter and

6608
03:26:17,439 --> 03:26:18,640
growing your following so more people

6609
03:26:18,640 --> 03:26:20,720
see it giving out value etc building

6610
03:26:20,720 --> 03:26:22,479
trust similar to the LinkedIn content

6611
03:26:22,479 --> 03:26:23,680
strategy again it's just different

6612
03:26:23,680 --> 03:26:25,359
platforms right so you can take this

6613
03:26:25,359 --> 03:26:27,359
idea of posting content and doing

6614
03:26:27,359 --> 03:26:29,439
outreach on basically any platform you

6615
03:26:29,439 --> 03:26:31,040
want LinkedIn and Twitter are good ones

6616
03:26:31,040 --> 03:26:32,479
but again you got to pick one and do it

6617
03:26:32,479 --> 03:26:34,160
well if you try to do both you could try

6618
03:26:34,160 --> 03:26:37,279
to crossro But there are nuances and and

6619
03:26:37,279 --> 03:26:39,279
intricacies and details that you pick up

6620
03:26:39,279 --> 03:26:40,640
on each of the platforms that are

6621
03:26:40,640 --> 03:26:41,760
different. And so if you're trying to

6622
03:26:41,760 --> 03:26:43,359
split yourself between learning LinkedIn

6623
03:26:43,359 --> 03:26:45,920
and becoming a really deep expert in

6624
03:26:45,920 --> 03:26:47,279
LinkedIn and then also doing Twitter as

6625
03:26:47,279 --> 03:26:49,120
well, it's going to be harder to reach

6626
03:26:49,120 --> 03:26:50,800
the the higher levels of success with

6627
03:26:50,800 --> 03:26:51,920
the platform if you're spreading

6628
03:26:51,920 --> 03:26:53,760
yourself too thin. So LinkedIn or

6629
03:26:53,760 --> 03:26:57,399
Twitter, same deal. Then number

6630
03:26:57,399 --> 03:27:00,120
nine is

6631
03:27:00,120 --> 03:27:02,399
YouTube. And I think you watching this

6632
03:27:02,399 --> 03:27:05,680
video is exhibit A of how YouTube works.

6633
03:27:05,680 --> 03:27:08,239
I have built my entire AI career off of

6634
03:27:08,239 --> 03:27:09,600
YouTube only. I haven't bothered doing

6635
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:11,200
anything else. Sure, do a bit posting on

6636
03:27:11,200 --> 03:27:13,040
LinkedIn, a bit on Twitter now. Um, but

6637
03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:14,319
my main thing has just been YouTube, but

6638
03:27:14,319 --> 03:27:15,520
I just focus on getting really good at

6639
03:27:15,520 --> 03:27:17,920
that and I've grown a massive following

6640
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:20,399
now on within the AI space and built

6641
03:27:20,399 --> 03:27:21,680
three different businesses off the back

6642
03:27:21,680 --> 03:27:24,000
of it. So, YouTube extremely effective.

6643
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:25,359
This is the gold standard of personal

6644
03:27:25,359 --> 03:27:26,720
branding because people sit here and

6645
03:27:26,720 --> 03:27:28,479
watch you for so long. you build up a

6646
03:27:28,479 --> 03:27:30,720
lot of trust and again you need

6647
03:27:30,720 --> 03:27:32,960
expertise, lead flow and credibility and

6648
03:27:32,960 --> 03:27:34,640
authority. YouTube handles those

6649
03:27:34,640 --> 03:27:35,920
secondary very very well. So if you're

6650
03:27:35,920 --> 03:27:37,520
able to get on camera and talk and and

6651
03:27:37,520 --> 03:27:38,880
sound like you're intelligent, like you

6652
03:27:38,880 --> 03:27:39,680
know what you're talking about and

6653
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:41,920
you've got experience, then people are

6654
03:27:41,920 --> 03:27:42,960
going to trust you a lot more and you're

6655
03:27:42,960 --> 03:27:44,080
going to get a lot of highly engaged

6656
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:45,600
leads messaging you as long as you've

6657
03:27:45,600 --> 03:27:46,720
set up a good funnel as well. But

6658
03:27:46,720 --> 03:27:48,800
YouTube a little bit more difficult as

6659
03:27:48,800 --> 03:27:50,399
you need to learn how to talk on camera

6660
03:27:50,399 --> 03:27:52,560
and not be uh really boring. But if you

6661
03:27:52,560 --> 03:27:53,600
can do it right, it can be a game

6662
03:27:53,600 --> 03:27:55,359
changer for your business and completely

6663
03:27:55,359 --> 03:27:56,720
transform your life as it has for me

6664
03:27:56,720 --> 03:27:58,560
over the past 18 months. Um, but for

6665
03:27:58,560 --> 03:27:59,760
YouTube, it's the same sort of deal with

6666
03:27:59,760 --> 03:28:01,200
LinkedIn content and Twitter content.

6667
03:28:01,200 --> 03:28:03,200
Give out value. Identify who the people

6668
03:28:03,200 --> 03:28:04,239
you're going to be selling to and the

6669
03:28:04,239 --> 03:28:06,080
people you want to engage with. Put

6670
03:28:06,080 --> 03:28:08,160
their niche or or who they are in the

6671
03:28:08,160 --> 03:28:10,399
title, in the thumbnail, etc. It's not

6672
03:28:10,399 --> 03:28:12,399
really that hard, but I will leave some

6673
03:28:12,399 --> 03:28:14,319
resources on the school as to how I got

6674
03:28:14,319 --> 03:28:16,080
started on YouTube and they'll be pretty

6675
03:28:16,080 --> 03:28:17,600
helpful for you to show. I mean, I got

6676
03:28:17,600 --> 03:28:19,040
off on the right foot immediately and

6677
03:28:19,040 --> 03:28:20,720
the resources that I used, I'll include

6678
03:28:20,720 --> 03:28:22,479
on the school community as well. So

6679
03:28:22,479 --> 03:28:24,080
getting into number 10 now. We are

6680
03:28:24,080 --> 03:28:26,319
almost halfway there. Number 10 is

6681
03:28:26,319 --> 03:28:30,080
medium articles. Now medium that's like

6682
03:28:30,080 --> 03:28:32,000
low, medium, high. If you're not sure

6683
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:33,359
and you can't read my writing, medium is

6684
03:28:33,359 --> 03:28:34,800
a platform that allows you to write

6685
03:28:34,800 --> 03:28:37,680
blogs, write articles, and it also has a

6686
03:28:37,680 --> 03:28:39,359
discoverability and kind of a an

6687
03:28:39,359 --> 03:28:40,960
algorithm that helps your content get

6688
03:28:40,960 --> 03:28:42,640
discovered by people who have never

6689
03:28:42,640 --> 03:28:44,479
followed you before, seen you before. So

6690
03:28:44,479 --> 03:28:46,399
in the same way that YouTube when you

6691
03:28:46,399 --> 03:28:47,920
post a video, it tries to put it out

6692
03:28:47,920 --> 03:28:49,200
there and find people who want to watch

6693
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:50,560
it. I think it's actually the other way

6694
03:28:50,560 --> 03:28:52,000
around. It finds videos that people want

6695
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:54,000
to watch, not people that want to watch

6696
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:55,520
your videos. But long story short, there

6697
03:28:55,520 --> 03:28:57,760
is discoverability on these platforms

6698
03:28:57,760 --> 03:28:59,520
where if you post something good, it can

6699
03:28:59,520 --> 03:29:01,040
reach a broader group of people who have

6700
03:29:01,040 --> 03:29:02,479
never heard of you and never seen seen

6701
03:29:02,479 --> 03:29:04,399
you before. Same thing on Medium, but it

6702
03:29:04,399 --> 03:29:05,840
is textbased and you can write an

6703
03:29:05,840 --> 03:29:07,600
article and give out some value talking

6704
03:29:07,600 --> 03:29:09,040
about how you've done this for a

6705
03:29:09,040 --> 03:29:10,640
business using AI or how you created

6706
03:29:10,640 --> 03:29:12,880
this cool system that does this uh using

6707
03:29:12,880 --> 03:29:15,439
AI again, but you don't have to put your

6708
03:29:15,439 --> 03:29:16,800
face on it. You don't have to lug around

6709
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:18,080
all this camera equipment. You don't

6710
03:29:18,080 --> 03:29:19,680
have to buy a whiteboard wherever you go

6711
03:29:19,680 --> 03:29:21,920
like I do. Um it's a lot more

6712
03:29:21,920 --> 03:29:23,200
lightweight than YouTube, but you can

6713
03:29:23,200 --> 03:29:25,040
still get the same kind of result. Not

6714
03:29:25,040 --> 03:29:26,479
not the same kind of results, but you

6715
03:29:26,479 --> 03:29:28,319
can still get results. And if you choose

6716
03:29:28,319 --> 03:29:29,760
again, these businesses, the reason

6717
03:29:29,760 --> 03:29:31,040
we're creating these businesses is to

6718
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:33,600
build the life of our dreams. Use AI to

6719
03:29:33,600 --> 03:29:34,880
create a life that we actually love

6720
03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:37,359
living in. All the all the perks and

6721
03:29:37,359 --> 03:29:39,200
benefits that we want and the lifestyle

6722
03:29:39,200 --> 03:29:41,040
that we want. If you are someone who

6723
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:42,160
doesn't want to have to get on camera

6724
03:29:42,160 --> 03:29:43,600
like this and lug these camera equipment

6725
03:29:43,600 --> 03:29:45,120
around and buy whiteboards and stuff,

6726
03:29:45,120 --> 03:29:47,120
this is a very good alternative to

6727
03:29:47,120 --> 03:29:48,560
YouTube. You can just be sitting on a

6728
03:29:48,560 --> 03:29:50,239
beach in Bali or wherever you want to go

6729
03:29:50,239 --> 03:29:51,760
and just be typing away in your laptop.

6730
03:29:51,760 --> 03:29:53,600
I'm a little bit envious of that. I like

6731
03:29:53,600 --> 03:29:55,359
writing, but at the end of the day for

6732
03:29:55,359 --> 03:29:56,880
me, YouTube is a bigger lever. I can put

6733
03:29:56,880 --> 03:29:58,160
more effort into it. I get to connect

6734
03:29:58,160 --> 03:30:00,399
with you all a much deeper level. But

6735
03:30:00,399 --> 03:30:01,680
for some people, Medium is a good

6736
03:30:01,680 --> 03:30:03,279
choice. And I've interviewed SJ, a

6737
03:30:03,279 --> 03:30:05,520
member of my accelerator who's making um

6738
03:30:05,520 --> 03:30:07,840
as a as a side hustle. And I I don't

6739
03:30:07,840 --> 03:30:09,439
usually recommend using this this model

6740
03:30:09,439 --> 03:30:11,000
as a side hustle. But he's been able to

6741
03:30:11,000 --> 03:30:12,960
learnmake.com and start posting on

6742
03:30:12,960 --> 03:30:14,399
Medium and now was making as much money

6743
03:30:14,399 --> 03:30:16,960
from his AI automation agency as from

6744
03:30:16,960 --> 03:30:18,720
his job. So he's able to supplement his

6745
03:30:18,720 --> 03:30:20,319
income and basically double his income

6746
03:30:20,319 --> 03:30:22,319
by just learningmake.com and then

6747
03:30:22,319 --> 03:30:24,080
posting his learnings and his journey

6748
03:30:24,080 --> 03:30:25,600
really sharing his journey on Medium,

6749
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:26,960
which is what I keep telling you guys to

6750
03:30:26,960 --> 03:30:28,560
do. Learn something, document it, and

6751
03:30:28,560 --> 03:30:29,359
then you're going to have two to three

6752
03:30:29,359 --> 03:30:30,880
months of evidence of why you are the

6753
03:30:30,880 --> 03:30:32,000
person you say you are, why you can help

6754
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:33,200
these businesses. And that helps with

6755
03:30:33,200 --> 03:30:34,800
that authority component of landing

6756
03:30:34,800 --> 03:30:36,880
these deals. So medium like text based

6757
03:30:36,880 --> 03:30:38,239
version of YouTube if you want to watch

6758
03:30:38,239 --> 03:30:39,680
that interview with SJ I had on the

6759
03:30:39,680 --> 03:30:40,720
channel recently where he talks about

6760
03:30:40,720 --> 03:30:42,080
how he's actually using medium and you

6761
03:30:42,080 --> 03:30:44,160
can see links to all his all his details

6762
03:30:44,160 --> 03:30:46,239
that'll be as one of the resources on

6763
03:30:46,239 --> 03:30:47,680
the school community for the medium side

6764
03:30:47,680 --> 03:30:50,239
of things. Okay, number 11 now is a bit

6765
03:30:50,239 --> 03:30:53,520
of a different one. Um it is

6766
03:30:53,520 --> 03:30:54,680
[Music]

6767
03:30:54,680 --> 03:30:58,800
charities and nonprofit organizations.

6768
03:30:58,800 --> 03:31:00,239
using charities and nonprofits to get

6769
03:31:00,239 --> 03:31:01,439
your first couple of clients is actually

6770
03:31:01,439 --> 03:31:02,960
a strategy that Mark put me on to and

6771
03:31:02,960 --> 03:31:04,399
I'm going to do a whole video on this a

6772
03:31:04,399 --> 03:31:06,160
little bit later, but basically uh if

6773
03:31:06,160 --> 03:31:07,279
you're looking to get your foot in the

6774
03:31:07,279 --> 03:31:08,479
door and build a bit of a couple

6775
03:31:08,479 --> 03:31:10,160
testimonials, get some real hands-on

6776
03:31:10,160 --> 03:31:11,680
experience and building AI solutions for

6777
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:12,720
businesses. So, instead of trying to

6778
03:31:12,720 --> 03:31:14,560
reach out to a profit- driven small

6779
03:31:14,560 --> 03:31:16,880
business owner who's a complete hard ass

6780
03:31:16,880 --> 03:31:18,960
and is very like bottom line focused,

6781
03:31:18,960 --> 03:31:20,319
you can reach out to these charities and

6782
03:31:20,319 --> 03:31:22,319
nonprofits and offer them free services

6783
03:31:22,319 --> 03:31:23,439
and say, "Hey, look, I would like to

6784
03:31:23,439 --> 03:31:24,960
build you this website chatbook. Would

6785
03:31:24,960 --> 03:31:26,319
you be interested? We're doing a thing

6786
03:31:26,319 --> 03:31:28,319
at our agency where we want to give back

6787
03:31:28,319 --> 03:31:30,080
to the community for businesses that

6788
03:31:30,080 --> 03:31:31,680
necessarily wouldn't get access to AI

6789
03:31:31,680 --> 03:31:33,359
solutions. Would you be interested? From

6790
03:31:33,359 --> 03:31:34,560
the screenshots that Mark sent through

6791
03:31:34,560 --> 03:31:35,840
of the email responses he was getting,

6792
03:31:35,840 --> 03:31:37,200
which I'm going to again cover in a

6793
03:31:37,200 --> 03:31:38,880
different video. Um, the response rate

6794
03:31:38,880 --> 03:31:39,920
was great and he was straight in the

6795
03:31:39,920 --> 03:31:41,359
door being able to build these solutions

6796
03:31:41,359 --> 03:31:42,800
for charities and nonprofits. So, if

6797
03:31:42,800 --> 03:31:43,760
you're looking for your first client,

6798
03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:45,200
that can be a very effective foot in the

6799
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:47,040
door uh to get started. Next, we have a

6800
03:31:47,040 --> 03:31:48,720
whole bunch of ad platforms that I'm

6801
03:31:48,720 --> 03:31:50,399
going to separate out because there I

6802
03:31:50,399 --> 03:31:51,439
don't want you guys to think you can do

6803
03:31:51,439 --> 03:31:53,760
them all at once. We have uh Google ads

6804
03:31:53,760 --> 03:31:55,319
as in

6805
03:31:55,319 --> 03:31:58,080
search. Then we have YouTube ads. We

6806
03:31:58,080 --> 03:32:00,319
have LinkedIn ads. Then we have meta

6807
03:32:00,319 --> 03:32:03,439
ads. So Facebook, uh WhatsApp, uh

6808
03:32:03,439 --> 03:32:04,680
Instagram,

6809
03:32:04,680 --> 03:32:07,920
etc. And so all of these, you know, that

6810
03:32:07,920 --> 03:32:09,359
Google is search by the way. So I'm

6811
03:32:09,359 --> 03:32:11,920
going to rub that off. All of these can

6812
03:32:11,920 --> 03:32:14,160
be learned individually and sent to some

6813
03:32:14,160 --> 03:32:16,520
kind of offer, whether that's a

6814
03:32:16,520 --> 03:32:19,640
free AI

6815
03:32:19,640 --> 03:32:22,200
audit, whether that's some kind of

6816
03:32:22,200 --> 03:32:24,279
lead

6817
03:32:24,279 --> 03:32:26,479
magnet where you give them an ebook,

6818
03:32:26,479 --> 03:32:28,800
etc. But each of these platforms offers

6819
03:32:28,800 --> 03:32:30,560
a very lucrative way to get clients in

6820
03:32:30,560 --> 03:32:32,960
this whole ad space. If you are someone

6821
03:32:32,960 --> 03:32:34,720
who has experience in digital marketing

6822
03:32:34,720 --> 03:32:38,399
uh like myself, this is a very exciting

6823
03:32:38,399 --> 03:32:40,399
place for the AI agency space right now

6824
03:32:40,399 --> 03:32:41,920
because very few people are

6825
03:32:41,920 --> 03:32:43,200
experimenting with actually getting

6826
03:32:43,200 --> 03:32:45,760
clients through paid paid traffic. So if

6827
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:47,040
you want to explore something, if you

6828
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:48,479
have these the skill set, these are not

6829
03:32:48,479 --> 03:32:50,160
something you can just casually pick up.

6830
03:32:50,160 --> 03:32:51,200
It does take quite a while and you are

6831
03:32:51,200 --> 03:32:52,880
going to need to focus on okay, I'm just

6832
03:32:52,880 --> 03:32:54,239
going to use search ads. I'm going to

6833
03:32:54,239 --> 03:32:56,080
run to this. There's a lot of you're

6834
03:32:56,080 --> 03:32:57,359
going to be spending money on ads of

6835
03:32:57,359 --> 03:32:58,640
course. So this is for people who are

6836
03:32:58,640 --> 03:33:00,319
perhaps willing to invest a little bit

6837
03:33:00,319 --> 03:33:02,160
more to get results faster. But if you

6838
03:33:02,160 --> 03:33:03,600
put a bunch of spend behind Google ads

6839
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:05,600
or YouTube ads and LinkedIn met ads,

6840
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:07,120
etc., and you spend time to focus on

6841
03:33:07,120 --> 03:33:09,200
just one platform and test this offer to

6842
03:33:09,200 --> 03:33:10,800
see what's converting the most, you will

6843
03:33:10,800 --> 03:33:12,880
find eventually you may need to bring in

6844
03:33:12,880 --> 03:33:14,399
an agency or bring in an expert, get a

6845
03:33:14,399 --> 03:33:16,479
consultant, etc. But you will find some

6846
03:33:16,479 --> 03:33:18,640
combination of ad creative and and copy

6847
03:33:18,640 --> 03:33:20,080
and messaging and also the offer that

6848
03:33:20,080 --> 03:33:21,840
you're making on your landing page that

6849
03:33:21,840 --> 03:33:23,520
is able to generate you leads and booked

6850
03:33:23,520 --> 03:33:25,200
calls on a consistent basis. and you can

6851
03:33:25,200 --> 03:33:27,040
turn up the the ad spend and you're

6852
03:33:27,040 --> 03:33:28,239
going to get more leads. So, this is

6853
03:33:28,239 --> 03:33:29,520
extremely lucrative and this is

6854
03:33:29,520 --> 03:33:31,520
something that is again still wide open

6855
03:33:31,520 --> 03:33:33,120
because myself and my business partner

6856
03:33:33,120 --> 03:33:35,680
Josh run a marketing agency extensive

6857
03:33:35,680 --> 03:33:38,160
marketing experience but because we site

6858
03:33:38,160 --> 03:33:39,520
all through YouTube we've never had to

6859
03:33:39,520 --> 03:33:41,040
run ads for our agency. So, we haven't

6860
03:33:41,040 --> 03:33:42,560
actually explored paid acquisition for

6861
03:33:42,560 --> 03:33:44,640
AI agency clients. So, it's still wide

6862
03:33:44,640 --> 03:33:46,160
open. I'd love to see more. We see it in

6863
03:33:46,160 --> 03:33:47,200
the accelerator. It's starting to come

6864
03:33:47,200 --> 03:33:48,800
up as you'll see a little bit later. Uh

6865
03:33:48,800 --> 03:33:50,399
but experimenting with these is is

6866
03:33:50,399 --> 03:33:51,840
extremely exciting space for me and I'm

6867
03:33:51,840 --> 03:33:52,800
looking forward to seeing how it

6868
03:33:52,800 --> 03:33:53,920
progresses. But like I said, if you're

6869
03:33:53,920 --> 03:33:55,279
going to do it, just pick one and do it

6870
03:33:55,279 --> 03:33:56,880
well and experiment back and forth, back

6871
03:33:56,880 --> 03:33:58,640
and forth until you're getting a good uh

6872
03:33:58,640 --> 03:34:00,960
cost per lead or whatever conversion

6873
03:34:00,960 --> 03:34:02,239
rate you're looking for, cost per

6874
03:34:02,239 --> 03:34:04,319
appointment booked, etc. So, number 16,

6875
03:34:04,319 --> 03:34:07,040
we have school communities. This is one

6876
03:34:07,040 --> 03:34:08,239
that we're starting to see quite a lot

6877
03:34:08,239 --> 03:34:09,840
in my accelerator where people are using

6878
03:34:09,840 --> 03:34:11,399
these school communities to find

6879
03:34:11,399 --> 03:34:14,479
hyperargeted pockets of their ideal uh

6880
03:34:14,479 --> 03:34:15,760
ideal customer, the business owners

6881
03:34:15,760 --> 03:34:17,600
they're trying to attract. And then they

6882
03:34:17,600 --> 03:34:18,720
can go in there and they can build a bit

6883
03:34:18,720 --> 03:34:19,920
of rapport. They can make posts. They

6884
03:34:19,920 --> 03:34:21,840
can network. They can DM directly and

6885
03:34:21,840 --> 03:34:23,439
use the school communities as a way of

6886
03:34:23,439 --> 03:34:24,800
just finding a big pool of the people

6887
03:34:24,800 --> 03:34:26,319
they want to get in touch with and then

6888
03:34:26,319 --> 03:34:27,760
working some leads in there as well. The

6889
03:34:27,760 --> 03:34:28,800
guy in my accelerator who's really

6890
03:34:28,800 --> 03:34:29,680
crushing it and getting a lot of

6891
03:34:29,680 --> 03:34:31,040
bookings with us at the moment, he's

6892
03:34:31,040 --> 03:34:32,720
selling an AI calling system to real

6893
03:34:32,720 --> 03:34:34,399
estate agencies and and agents. And what

6894
03:34:34,399 --> 03:34:35,760
he's doing is finding school communities

6895
03:34:35,760 --> 03:34:37,200
that have the people that he's trying to

6896
03:34:37,200 --> 03:34:38,800
sell to. He's going in, he's making

6897
03:34:38,800 --> 03:34:40,960
posts, he's sharing value, he's directly

6898
03:34:40,960 --> 03:34:43,600
DMing people and building up a a bit of

6899
03:34:43,600 --> 03:34:44,800
rapport in the community and then

6900
03:34:44,800 --> 03:34:46,080
getting a ton of bookings from there by

6901
03:34:46,080 --> 03:34:48,160
just sending a l by DM, etc. School

6902
03:34:48,160 --> 03:34:49,439
communities are great for that and

6903
03:34:49,439 --> 03:34:50,640
finding a big pocket of people that you

6904
03:34:50,640 --> 03:34:52,000
want to get in touch with. You do have

6905
03:34:52,000 --> 03:34:53,200
to be wary when you're doing the school

6906
03:34:53,200 --> 03:34:54,640
community strategies not to come in too

6907
03:34:54,640 --> 03:34:56,000
hot and just immediately start saying,

6908
03:34:56,000 --> 03:34:57,439
"I sell this, who wants to buy it?"

6909
03:34:57,439 --> 03:34:58,560
Because you get banned immediately. If

6910
03:34:58,560 --> 03:34:59,600
you do that stuff in my community,

6911
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:03,439
you'll get banned instantly. Um, but if

6912
03:35:03,439 --> 03:35:04,640
you can go in and build a bit of

6913
03:35:04,640 --> 03:35:06,319
rapport, you you make posts, you become

6914
03:35:06,319 --> 03:35:08,479
known as a p, the AI guy or girl in the

6915
03:35:08,479 --> 03:35:09,840
community that they can go to to talk

6916
03:35:09,840 --> 03:35:11,120
to, you get in touch with the

6917
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:12,560
moderators, you get in touch with the

6918
03:35:12,560 --> 03:35:15,120
owners, etc. You make yourself a a a

6919
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:16,720
part of that community and give out a

6920
03:35:16,720 --> 03:35:18,160
lot of free value and actually add to

6921
03:35:18,160 --> 03:35:20,399
the net net sum of the value in that

6922
03:35:20,399 --> 03:35:21,359
community, then you'll be able to

6923
03:35:21,359 --> 03:35:22,720
generate leads in that community

6924
03:35:22,720 --> 03:35:24,160
basically whenever you want if you have

6925
03:35:24,160 --> 03:35:25,600
a good offer and if you have new stuff

6926
03:35:25,600 --> 03:35:28,000
to sell them. a extremely effective

6927
03:35:28,000 --> 03:35:29,600
strategy because it's hyperargeted and

6928
03:35:29,600 --> 03:35:31,920
you know if you go into a large school

6929
03:35:31,920 --> 03:35:34,319
community and you spend 2 3 months even

6930
03:35:34,319 --> 03:35:35,680
building up rapport and becoming the

6931
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:37,120
person within that community they can go

6932
03:35:37,120 --> 03:35:38,800
to is if it's big enough you have

6933
03:35:38,800 --> 03:35:40,160
basically infinite pool of people and

6934
03:35:40,160 --> 03:35:41,359
there's always people coming into these

6935
03:35:41,359 --> 03:35:43,520
communities as well. So you've got a an

6936
03:35:43,520 --> 03:35:45,120
excellent client acquisition method if

6937
03:35:45,120 --> 03:35:46,720
you choose to do this. But again, if you

6938
03:35:46,720 --> 03:35:48,080
just pick one and do it well, you'll

6939
03:35:48,080 --> 03:35:49,520
have enough clients um to get you off

6940
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:51,920
the road. And similarly to this, we have

6941
03:35:51,920 --> 03:35:54,080
Facebook groups, we have LinkedIn

6942
03:35:54,080 --> 03:35:55,359
groups. All right, so same sort of thing

6943
03:35:55,359 --> 03:35:56,560
applies here. LinkedIn and Facebook

6944
03:35:56,560 --> 03:35:58,080
groups. Your first thing is finding the

6945
03:35:58,080 --> 03:35:59,680
group. You need to find someone that has

6946
03:35:59,680 --> 03:36:01,120
the people that you want to sell to in

6947
03:36:01,120 --> 03:36:02,960
it. Um and that means picking a specific

6948
03:36:02,960 --> 03:36:04,720
niche or a type of customer that you

6949
03:36:04,720 --> 03:36:06,800
want to be selling to. Facebook groups,

6950
03:36:06,800 --> 03:36:08,080
go on Facebook, have a little search

6951
03:36:08,080 --> 03:36:09,279
around, try to get into a couple of

6952
03:36:09,279 --> 03:36:11,359
them. LinkedIn group, same sort of deal.

6953
03:36:11,359 --> 03:36:12,960
But as I said with the school

6954
03:36:12,960 --> 03:36:14,160
communities, don't come in hot. Don't

6955
03:36:14,160 --> 03:36:15,120
just come in and start selling

6956
03:36:15,120 --> 03:36:16,720
immediately. That's not going to last.

6957
03:36:16,720 --> 03:36:18,080
You might get a couple call bookings

6958
03:36:18,080 --> 03:36:19,840
from people who are probably quite

6959
03:36:19,840 --> 03:36:20,960
stupid if they're just going to click

6960
03:36:20,960 --> 03:36:22,880
some random guy selling selling stuff in

6961
03:36:22,880 --> 03:36:24,160
their community. But if you can build up

6962
03:36:24,160 --> 03:36:26,479
a bit of rapport, get become familiar

6963
03:36:26,479 --> 03:36:27,680
with the people in the community, be

6964
03:36:27,680 --> 03:36:29,120
known as someone who provides value and

6965
03:36:29,120 --> 03:36:30,399
someone's trustworthy. Again, the

6966
03:36:30,399 --> 03:36:32,239
authority and credibility that you need

6967
03:36:32,239 --> 03:36:33,520
to be able to close deals. If you give

6968
03:36:33,520 --> 03:36:34,960
away some free value in these, you can

6969
03:36:34,960 --> 03:36:36,399
be sure that you're going to be getting

6970
03:36:36,399 --> 03:36:38,080
a bunch of interest and hopefully you

6971
03:36:38,080 --> 03:36:39,359
convert that into bookings and clients

6972
03:36:39,359 --> 03:36:42,080
as well. Right. Number 19 is cold

6973
03:36:42,080 --> 03:36:43,640
calling. Now, this is everyone's

6974
03:36:43,640 --> 03:36:46,160
favorite. Uh but it is quite terrifying

6975
03:36:46,160 --> 03:36:48,000
for most people and it is something that

6976
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:49,600
if you did choose to do it well and just

6977
03:36:49,600 --> 03:36:50,800
said, "Okay, I'm just going to learn how

6978
03:36:50,800 --> 03:36:52,000
to cold call businesses and get them

6979
03:36:52,000 --> 03:36:53,840
interested in AI solutions." That would

6980
03:36:53,840 --> 03:36:55,040
be all you need to do. And then you

6981
03:36:55,040 --> 03:36:56,239
could teach other people how to do it on

6982
03:36:56,239 --> 03:36:58,000
your behalf as well. So, while it is

6983
03:36:58,000 --> 03:37:00,080
terrifying, it is extremely effective.

6984
03:37:00,080 --> 03:37:01,359
you can in the space of a couple of

6985
03:37:01,359 --> 03:37:03,279
hours call hundreds of businesses and

6986
03:37:03,279 --> 03:37:05,040
offer them your services. So it's in

6987
03:37:05,040 --> 03:37:06,560
terms of input output and the amount of

6988
03:37:06,560 --> 03:37:08,000
time and effort you put in to the

6989
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:09,600
potential output. If you were doing that

6990
03:37:09,600 --> 03:37:10,880
every single day, there is no way that

6991
03:37:10,880 --> 03:37:12,720
you would not get clients. So I will

6992
03:37:12,720 --> 03:37:14,319
leave some resources on how to get into

6993
03:37:14,319 --> 03:37:15,920
cold calling on the school community as

6994
03:37:15,920 --> 03:37:18,560
well. Number 20, again talking about

6995
03:37:18,560 --> 03:37:22,520
input output is expose and

6996
03:37:22,520 --> 03:37:26,319
events. So, if there is a type of

6997
03:37:26,319 --> 03:37:27,760
business owner or an industry that you

6998
03:37:27,760 --> 03:37:29,439
want to target and there is an exponent

6999
03:37:29,439 --> 03:37:31,760
or an event in a big city near you, if

7000
03:37:31,760 --> 03:37:32,960
you go in there, it might even just be a

7001
03:37:32,960 --> 03:37:34,399
local one, but if you go there, you're

7002
03:37:34,399 --> 03:37:36,319
going to be surrounded by your ideal

7003
03:37:36,319 --> 03:37:38,960
customer, you have infinite chances

7004
03:37:38,960 --> 03:37:40,399
basically to go and have conversations

7005
03:37:40,399 --> 03:37:41,600
with them and learn more about them and

7006
03:37:41,600 --> 03:37:42,800
get in their head. If you are trying to

7007
03:37:42,800 --> 03:37:44,800
be a niche agency and focusing on

7008
03:37:44,800 --> 03:37:46,560
selling to a specific type of people,

7009
03:37:46,560 --> 03:37:48,399
this is a in terms of the density of of

7010
03:37:48,399 --> 03:37:50,160
how many people you can talk to in a

7011
03:37:50,160 --> 03:37:51,439
short space of time and the

7012
03:37:51,439 --> 03:37:53,359
effectiveness of that, it's going to be

7013
03:37:53,359 --> 03:37:55,200
basically unmatched anywhere else, any

7014
03:37:55,200 --> 03:37:56,319
other method that you're trying to reach

7015
03:37:56,319 --> 03:37:57,600
out to people, right? So, if you're

7016
03:37:57,600 --> 03:38:00,000
there in the space of 4 hours, 5 hours,

7017
03:38:00,000 --> 03:38:01,279
6 hours at one of these events and

7018
03:38:01,279 --> 03:38:02,800
expose, you can have conversations with

7019
03:38:02,800 --> 03:38:04,720
dozens of people, get dozens of numbers

7020
03:38:04,720 --> 03:38:06,239
and contacts, offer them your services,

7021
03:38:06,239 --> 03:38:07,680
let them know who you are. These can

7022
03:38:07,680 --> 03:38:08,960
feel a little bit awkward. you're a

7023
03:38:08,960 --> 03:38:11,040
stranger walking around a expo trying to

7024
03:38:11,040 --> 03:38:12,560
sell your AI services, but in the space

7025
03:38:12,560 --> 03:38:14,640
of just one day of relative discomfort,

7026
03:38:14,640 --> 03:38:16,720
yes, I know, you can put yourself and

7027
03:38:16,720 --> 03:38:18,239
your business further ahead than if you

7028
03:38:18,239 --> 03:38:19,760
spent a month or two doing any of this

7029
03:38:19,760 --> 03:38:21,600
stuff, right? So, you can get a massive

7030
03:38:21,600 --> 03:38:23,520
leaprog forward for your business in

7031
03:38:23,520 --> 03:38:24,720
terms of the connections you have and

7032
03:38:24,720 --> 03:38:26,319
the potential clients in the pipeline.

7033
03:38:26,319 --> 03:38:28,319
So, while uncomfortable, extremely

7034
03:38:28,319 --> 03:38:29,560
effective and

7035
03:38:29,560 --> 03:38:31,080
similarly

7036
03:38:31,080 --> 03:38:33,160
21 is

7037
03:38:33,160 --> 03:38:35,760
walk-ins. So, in this digital age, we

7038
03:38:35,760 --> 03:38:36,800
kind of forget that you can just walk

7039
03:38:36,800 --> 03:38:38,640
into a business and and say hi and and

7040
03:38:38,640 --> 03:38:39,680
introduce yourself and offer your

7041
03:38:39,680 --> 03:38:41,120
services. All you need to do is search

7042
03:38:41,120 --> 03:38:42,560
up the types of businesses that you want

7043
03:38:42,560 --> 03:38:44,239
to find on Google. You can get a big

7044
03:38:44,239 --> 03:38:45,840
list of their addresses and then in one

7045
03:38:45,840 --> 03:38:47,680
day you can go out and walk into a whole

7046
03:38:47,680 --> 03:38:48,720
bunch of these businesses. Now, the

7047
03:38:48,720 --> 03:38:49,920
tricky part here, of course, is when

7048
03:38:49,920 --> 03:38:51,040
you're walking into these businesses,

7049
03:38:51,040 --> 03:38:52,000
what do you actually do when you're in

7050
03:38:52,000 --> 03:38:53,439
there? What's the process? If there's a

7051
03:38:53,439 --> 03:38:55,200
receptionist, what do you ask for, etc.

7052
03:38:55,200 --> 03:38:56,479
This is going to vary from industry to

7053
03:38:56,479 --> 03:38:57,359
industry. So, you're going to need to

7054
03:38:57,359 --> 03:38:59,760
come up with your own strategy. I can't

7055
03:38:59,760 --> 03:39:01,120
spoon feed you something here, but

7056
03:39:01,120 --> 03:39:02,800
essentially if there are businesses in

7057
03:39:02,800 --> 03:39:04,479
your town or city that are the kind of

7058
03:39:04,479 --> 03:39:05,840
people that you want to be selling to,

7059
03:39:05,840 --> 03:39:07,200
you can walk in there and introduce

7060
03:39:07,200 --> 03:39:09,200
yourself and offer your services. Highle

7061
03:39:09,200 --> 03:39:11,040
overview of that. Next, our second to

7062
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:13,720
last one, as you probably expected, is

7063
03:39:13,720 --> 03:39:16,520
cold

7064
03:39:16,520 --> 03:39:21,640
email. Cold email to uh

7065
03:39:21,640 --> 03:39:24,520
free order slash

7066
03:39:24,520 --> 03:39:28,399
lead magnet slashfree service. So cold

7067
03:39:28,399 --> 03:39:31,120
email of course pretty well established

7068
03:39:31,120 --> 03:39:32,560
method for getting in touch with people

7069
03:39:32,560 --> 03:39:33,439
and letting them know about your

7070
03:39:33,439 --> 03:39:35,359
services. Again advertising is just to

7071
03:39:35,359 --> 03:39:36,960
make known. So we're making our business

7072
03:39:36,960 --> 03:39:38,800
and our services known to people via

7073
03:39:38,800 --> 03:39:40,160
these different methods. And so cold

7074
03:39:40,160 --> 03:39:41,359
email is a way of getting in touch with

7075
03:39:41,359 --> 03:39:43,279
them using a platform like instantly is

7076
03:39:43,279 --> 03:39:45,279
the best one to go go with by far. So

7077
03:39:45,279 --> 03:39:46,960
instantly is a cold email platform and

7078
03:39:46,960 --> 03:39:48,399
they make everything extremely easy for

7079
03:39:48,399 --> 03:39:49,359
you if you're looking to use this

7080
03:39:49,359 --> 03:39:50,800
method. But the tricky thing with cold

7081
03:39:50,800 --> 03:39:53,040
email is one how to get high quality

7082
03:39:53,040 --> 03:39:54,720
leads. So that's an entire problem in

7083
03:39:54,720 --> 03:39:55,760
itself. making sure that you're sending

7084
03:39:55,760 --> 03:39:57,359
out to people who really could use your

7085
03:39:57,359 --> 03:39:58,560
services. But then you need to think

7086
03:39:58,560 --> 03:39:59,920
what the actual offer is and what you're

7087
03:39:59,920 --> 03:40:01,439
saying within these these emails, right?

7088
03:40:01,439 --> 03:40:03,279
So got a couple options here. Firstly, a

7089
03:40:03,279 --> 03:40:05,920
free AI audit similar to this. So it's

7090
03:40:05,920 --> 03:40:07,680
again similar to these ads here, right?

7091
03:40:07,680 --> 03:40:09,359
Where you're making some kind of offer.

7092
03:40:09,359 --> 03:40:11,760
Hey, click here to do this or in cold

7093
03:40:11,760 --> 03:40:13,200
email. You don't want to send any links

7094
03:40:13,200 --> 03:40:14,560
or anything in the in the message

7095
03:40:14,560 --> 03:40:16,000
itself. You just want to create some

7096
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:17,520
interest and say, hey, would you be

7097
03:40:17,520 --> 03:40:18,960
interested in me sending this over or

7098
03:40:18,960 --> 03:40:19,920
would you like to know a little bit more

7099
03:40:19,920 --> 03:40:21,279
about this? Just reply yes and I'll

7100
03:40:21,279 --> 03:40:22,720
shoot it over. So in this way you can

7101
03:40:22,720 --> 03:40:24,720
say, "Hey, look, we do free AI audits

7102
03:40:24,720 --> 03:40:26,160
for this assist. If you're interested,

7103
03:40:26,160 --> 03:40:27,680
we have a couple slots coming up next

7104
03:40:27,680 --> 03:40:29,520
week for AI audits. Please just reply to

7105
03:40:29,520 --> 03:40:30,800
this with a yes and I'll send you some

7106
03:40:30,800 --> 03:40:32,399
more information on the AI audit and how

7107
03:40:32,399 --> 03:40:33,760
you can book." So they reply with yes

7108
03:40:33,760 --> 03:40:34,960
and then you send them the information.

7109
03:40:34,960 --> 03:40:36,399
Same goes with the lead magnet. I've

7110
03:40:36,399 --> 03:40:37,680
personally tested this lead method out

7111
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:39,200
and it works. If you have some kind of

7112
03:40:39,200 --> 03:40:40,800
ebook or resource that you create, you

7113
03:40:40,800 --> 03:40:42,319
can send out cold email and people go to

7114
03:40:42,319 --> 03:40:44,080
reply and say, "Hey, yes, I'd like that

7115
03:40:44,080 --> 03:40:47,600
free AI value ebook for XYZ niche." Or

7116
03:40:47,600 --> 03:40:49,359
finally, you can offer a free service or

7117
03:40:49,359 --> 03:40:50,720
product. This is actually a method used

7118
03:40:50,720 --> 03:40:52,640
by a lot of people within my accelerator

7119
03:40:52,640 --> 03:40:53,840
just to get their agencies off the

7120
03:40:53,840 --> 03:40:55,520
ground particularly when you don't have

7121
03:40:55,520 --> 03:40:57,279
the testimonials and the case studies to

7122
03:40:57,279 --> 03:40:58,960
have that authority and credibility to

7123
03:40:58,960 --> 03:41:00,399
get those deals signed. Right? So that's

7124
03:41:00,399 --> 03:41:02,640
third technical expertise, lead flow and

7125
03:41:02,640 --> 03:41:03,920
then authority and credibility that when

7126
03:41:03,920 --> 03:41:05,200
you start out you don't really have that

7127
03:41:05,200 --> 03:41:06,319
third one because you haven't done

7128
03:41:06,319 --> 03:41:07,600
anything. And that's why if you create

7129
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:09,040
content documenting your learnings, you

7130
03:41:09,040 --> 03:41:10,160
have some you at least you have

7131
03:41:10,160 --> 03:41:11,600
something going into it. Whereas if

7132
03:41:11,600 --> 03:41:12,800
you're starting out where a lot of these

7133
03:41:12,800 --> 03:41:14,479
guys did, they had nothing. So they had

7134
03:41:14,479 --> 03:41:16,239
to offer these free chat bots and say,

7135
03:41:16,239 --> 03:41:17,520
"Hey, look, we'll build this thing for

7136
03:41:17,520 --> 03:41:19,439
you um free of charge." and that got

7137
03:41:19,439 --> 03:41:20,880
their foot in the door to open up to

7138
03:41:20,880 --> 03:41:22,560
upselles and further AI solutions for

7139
03:41:22,560 --> 03:41:24,000
them. So from there, they're able to

7140
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:26,000
sell them two, three, $4,000 products or

7141
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:28,160
services on top of that. But the free

7142
03:41:28,160 --> 03:41:29,760
service is another great one and I

7143
03:41:29,760 --> 03:41:31,279
highly recommend you testing those out

7144
03:41:31,279 --> 03:41:32,800
if you choose to do cold email. Again,

7145
03:41:32,800 --> 03:41:34,239
if you just do cold email and do it

7146
03:41:34,239 --> 03:41:36,239
well, test all these different offers

7147
03:41:36,239 --> 03:41:37,760
and test a bunch of different lead

7148
03:41:37,760 --> 03:41:39,680
sources. I promise you, you will get

7149
03:41:39,680 --> 03:41:40,800
results if you're sending out enough

7150
03:41:40,800 --> 03:41:43,760
emails. And finally, lucky last, saving

7151
03:41:43,760 --> 03:41:45,560
potentially the best for last.

7152
03:41:45,560 --> 03:41:49,600
23 is a webinar funnel plus ads. Now,

7153
03:41:49,600 --> 03:41:51,920
this is an exciting one um that's come

7154
03:41:51,920 --> 03:41:53,439
out of my accelerator. We've got some

7155
03:41:53,439 --> 03:41:54,640
people in there who have experimented

7156
03:41:54,640 --> 03:41:56,720
with this and are seeing success running

7157
03:41:56,720 --> 03:41:58,880
ads to some kind of webinar signup where

7158
03:41:58,880 --> 03:42:00,960
it's like an AI learn more about how how

7159
03:42:00,960 --> 03:42:03,040
AI can help your business. Sign up. I

7160
03:42:03,040 --> 03:42:04,560
believe the person who first did it was

7161
03:42:04,560 --> 03:42:07,840
using a uh a $3 kind of wallet checking

7162
03:42:07,840 --> 03:42:08,960
them to see if they're actually willing

7163
03:42:08,960 --> 03:42:10,399
to pay at all. So, you can put a micro

7164
03:42:10,399 --> 03:42:11,760
commitment down where they have to pay

7165
03:42:11,760 --> 03:42:13,439
$3 to sign up and get access to the

7166
03:42:13,439 --> 03:42:16,640
webinar. And then when they host a

7167
03:42:16,640 --> 03:42:17,680
webinar, they're sitting there, they do

7168
03:42:17,680 --> 03:42:19,120
a live event, but they're going through

7169
03:42:19,120 --> 03:42:20,640
and explaining them. They get a chance

7170
03:42:20,640 --> 03:42:22,399
to build trust and and authority and

7171
03:42:22,399 --> 03:42:23,840
credibility with the people who have

7172
03:42:23,840 --> 03:42:25,200
signed up. And then this person from

7173
03:42:25,200 --> 03:42:26,479
Accelerator was able to convert that

7174
03:42:26,479 --> 03:42:28,960
into a $10,000 sale. So, they've signed

7175
03:42:28,960 --> 03:42:31,279
a client for $10,000 based off running

7176
03:42:31,279 --> 03:42:33,840
ads to this $3 micro commitment um and

7177
03:42:33,840 --> 03:42:35,920
getting a chance to show their expertise

7178
03:42:35,920 --> 03:42:37,600
and what they know about AI and how it

7179
03:42:37,600 --> 03:42:39,359
can benefit businesses through a

7180
03:42:39,359 --> 03:42:40,960
webinar. Now, if you're not entirely

7181
03:42:40,960 --> 03:42:42,319
sure what a webinar is, I'll put some

7182
03:42:42,319 --> 03:42:44,399
resources on the school to to let you

7183
03:42:44,399 --> 03:42:46,000
know how a webinar funnel works. A

7184
03:42:46,000 --> 03:42:47,520
pretty popular method of selling things

7185
03:42:47,520 --> 03:42:49,600
online. Russell Brunson was really the

7186
03:42:49,600 --> 03:42:50,800
guy who just made these things massive

7187
03:42:50,800 --> 03:42:53,040
and got them super dialed in. But this

7188
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:55,760
is could potentially be put into

7189
03:42:55,760 --> 03:42:58,319
something here, but I want to keep it

7190
03:42:58,319 --> 03:42:59,840
separate cuz it is a really new and

7191
03:42:59,840 --> 03:43:01,600
exciting one that that deserves its own

7192
03:43:01,600 --> 03:43:03,040
its own category here that I wanted to

7193
03:43:03,040 --> 03:43:04,160
dive into a little deeper. And so,

7194
03:43:04,160 --> 03:43:05,760
that's about all for the video. As I

7195
03:43:05,760 --> 03:43:07,359
mentioned, all the resources for these

7196
03:43:07,359 --> 03:43:08,960
under each of these different methods,

7197
03:43:08,960 --> 03:43:10,319
I'm going to provide some YouTube links,

7198
03:43:10,319 --> 03:43:12,319
some free resources for each of these if

7199
03:43:12,319 --> 03:43:13,920
you want to learn how to go deeper on

7200
03:43:13,920 --> 03:43:15,120
them and actually learn how to do it and

7201
03:43:15,120 --> 03:43:17,120
implement it within your agency. So, um,

7202
03:43:17,120 --> 03:43:18,720
I hope this been valuable. There's a lot

7203
03:43:18,720 --> 03:43:20,080
there. Again, you only need to do one

7204
03:43:20,080 --> 03:43:22,160
and do it well, whether that's a Fiverr,

7205
03:43:22,160 --> 03:43:23,920
whether that's Medium, whether that's

7206
03:43:23,920 --> 03:43:25,680
YouTube like I've done. If you just pick

7207
03:43:25,680 --> 03:43:28,319
one and spend a solid 3 to 6 months

7208
03:43:28,319 --> 03:43:29,600
really working on just getting the

7209
03:43:29,600 --> 03:43:30,960
results out of that platform, then you

7210
03:43:30,960 --> 03:43:32,080
will see results. But if you keep

7211
03:43:32,080 --> 03:43:33,520
chopping and changing and you're doing a

7212
03:43:33,520 --> 03:43:35,040
new one every 2 weeks, you're not going

7213
03:43:35,040 --> 03:43:36,319
to see results. If you jump in and do

7214
03:43:36,319 --> 03:43:38,560
cold email for a few few weeks and it's

7215
03:43:38,560 --> 03:43:39,680
not working well, it's cuz you didn't

7216
03:43:39,680 --> 03:43:42,160
actually push through and continue to

7217
03:43:42,160 --> 03:43:44,319
absorb more information and seek seek

7218
03:43:44,319 --> 03:43:46,640
expert advice, find niche YouTube videos

7219
03:43:46,640 --> 03:43:48,399
on how to get the most out of it. You

7220
03:43:48,399 --> 03:43:49,680
need to keep assisting on one of these

7221
03:43:49,680 --> 03:43:50,800
platforms in order to get the most out

7222
03:43:50,800 --> 03:43:52,080
of it and for you to create a system

7223
03:43:52,080 --> 03:43:53,439
that's going to bring you leads

7224
03:43:53,439 --> 03:43:56,000
consistently. So, all of it's on the

7225
03:43:56,000 --> 03:43:57,199
school community that's down below. I

7226
03:43:57,199 --> 03:43:58,160
know a lot of you guys are already in

7227
03:43:58,160 --> 03:43:59,439
there. Um, we've got an excellent

7228
03:43:59,439 --> 03:44:00,640
community over there. The link to join

7229
03:44:00,640 --> 03:44:01,840
the school community is going to be the

7230
03:44:01,840 --> 03:44:03,120
first one in the description down below.

7231
03:44:03,120 --> 03:44:04,560
So you can join there. I'll see you in

7232
03:44:04,560 --> 03:44:06,239
there for my Friday Q&A if you guys want

7233
03:44:06,239 --> 03:44:08,880
to ask me questions

7234
03:44:09,800 --> 03:44:12,000
directly. So over the Christmas and New

7235
03:44:12,000 --> 03:44:13,439
Year break, I did a bunch of surveying

7236
03:44:13,439 --> 03:44:14,960
in my school community and elsewhere

7237
03:44:14,960 --> 03:44:16,239
asking you all what your biggest

7238
03:44:16,239 --> 03:44:17,920
problems were in in the current moment

7239
03:44:17,920 --> 03:44:20,080
with your AI automation agency. And one

7240
03:44:20,080 --> 03:44:21,920
of the biggest problems that uh revealed

7241
03:44:21,920 --> 03:44:23,279
itself is that you guys are struggling

7242
03:44:23,279 --> 03:44:25,439
with consistent uh lead generation. and

7243
03:44:25,439 --> 03:44:26,880
you might have just started the business

7244
03:44:26,880 --> 03:44:28,160
and you've got maybe your first client

7245
03:44:28,160 --> 03:44:29,840
or two, but you don't have to take it to

7246
03:44:29,840 --> 03:44:31,680
that next stage of saying, "Oh, now I've

7247
03:44:31,680 --> 03:44:33,439
got a consistent stream of bookings

7248
03:44:33,439 --> 03:44:34,960
coming in so that you can actually start

7249
03:44:34,960 --> 03:44:36,720
to hire a team and and have some kind of

7250
03:44:36,720 --> 03:44:38,720
consistency so that you know you can

7251
03:44:38,720 --> 03:44:39,920
actually build this business on a

7252
03:44:39,920 --> 03:44:41,760
longerterm basis than than just like one

7253
03:44:41,760 --> 03:44:43,040
client to the other and always worrying

7254
03:44:43,040 --> 03:44:44,560
about where the next one's coming from.

7255
03:44:44,560 --> 03:44:46,160
So, in this video, I'm going to be

7256
03:44:46,160 --> 03:44:47,840
walking you through basically the exact

7257
03:44:47,840 --> 03:44:49,199
system that I've used to generate

7258
03:44:49,199 --> 03:44:51,120
thousands of leads for my AI automation

7259
03:44:51,120 --> 03:44:54,239
agency morning AI and uh really just

7260
03:44:54,239 --> 03:44:55,840
give you a bit of a marketing masterass

7261
03:44:55,840 --> 03:44:58,239
if I do say so myself. Um, from my six

7262
03:44:58,239 --> 03:45:00,000
years in in digital marketing, I've done

7263
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:01,680
everything from like running paid ads to

7264
03:45:01,680 --> 03:45:03,040
sell physical products through like

7265
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:04,880
Shopify, drop shipping, etc., U

7266
03:45:04,880 --> 03:45:07,680
marketing agency um sort of typical way

7267
03:45:07,680 --> 03:45:10,479
we make and more importantly and more

7268
03:45:10,479 --> 03:45:12,640
recently uh organic content funnels and

7269
03:45:12,640 --> 03:45:15,600
how to make content like this um and on

7270
03:45:15,600 --> 03:45:17,520
other platforms and to consistently this

7271
03:45:17,520 --> 03:45:19,120
says infinite leads if you can't see it

7272
03:45:19,120 --> 03:45:21,600
but to consistently convert strangers

7273
03:45:21,600 --> 03:45:24,160
into uh leads and then ultimately to

7274
03:45:24,160 --> 03:45:25,439
sales as well. So I'm not going to be

7275
03:45:25,439 --> 03:45:26,960
touching on the sales section of this

7276
03:45:26,960 --> 03:45:28,760
video. I think that deserved its whole

7277
03:45:28,760 --> 03:45:31,680
own own video entirely. But I'm going to

7278
03:45:31,680 --> 03:45:34,000
focus on the lead generation portion of

7279
03:45:34,000 --> 03:45:36,000
breaking down exactly how this works.

7280
03:45:36,000 --> 03:45:37,600
And I think a lot of you want to do

7281
03:45:37,600 --> 03:45:39,840
this, but you don't quite understand

7282
03:45:39,840 --> 03:45:41,199
don't understand how this mechanism

7283
03:45:41,199 --> 03:45:43,279
works. So it's actually not too complex.

7284
03:45:43,279 --> 03:45:44,640
And I'm going to break it down for you.

7285
03:45:44,640 --> 03:45:45,600
And at the end of the video, I'm going

7286
03:45:45,600 --> 03:45:47,840
to be giving you a a resource that you

7287
03:45:47,840 --> 03:45:49,600
can take to put this into plan. So I

7288
03:45:49,600 --> 03:45:50,960
know you guys might look at what I do on

7289
03:45:50,960 --> 03:45:52,560
YouTube now and think that's that's sort

7290
03:45:52,560 --> 03:45:54,000
of a bit more advanced than I'm unable

7291
03:45:54,000 --> 03:45:55,760
to do right now. But I'm going to boil

7292
03:45:55,760 --> 03:45:57,600
this down to if I was starting again.

7293
03:45:57,600 --> 03:46:00,560
Um, and I mean, I've generated like 10

7294
03:46:00,560 --> 03:46:02,319
10 million plus views or something. I

7295
03:46:02,319 --> 03:46:03,600
got a lot of subscribers next to my

7296
03:46:03,600 --> 03:46:06,080
name. So, I know a decent amount about

7297
03:46:06,080 --> 03:46:09,040
this. And, uh, I'm going to give you

7298
03:46:09,040 --> 03:46:10,800
what I would the exact strategy and the

7299
03:46:10,800 --> 03:46:12,640
sort of blueprint for starting a a

7300
03:46:12,640 --> 03:46:14,399
organic content funnel like this that I

7301
03:46:14,399 --> 03:46:15,600
would do if I was getting started again

7302
03:46:15,600 --> 03:46:18,239
with my AI automation agency. So, to get

7303
03:46:18,239 --> 03:46:19,680
started, this is going to be a bit of a

7304
03:46:19,680 --> 03:46:21,760
slower pace video by the way. Um, this

7305
03:46:21,760 --> 03:46:24,800
is Sunday afternoon here. U and guys out

7306
03:46:24,800 --> 03:46:27,040
there building a sauna. So I thought

7307
03:46:27,040 --> 03:46:28,239
this is a good chance for me to give you

7308
03:46:28,239 --> 03:46:29,680
guys a breakdown of the marketing side

7309
03:46:29,680 --> 03:46:31,199
of things. So it's not going to be super

7310
03:46:31,199 --> 03:46:33,520
Tik Tok brain optimized. I'm sorry, but

7311
03:46:33,520 --> 03:46:35,359
I promise you it's going to be some

7312
03:46:35,359 --> 03:46:36,960
extremely valuable information for you

7313
03:46:36,960 --> 03:46:39,199
if you are looking to scale your auto

7314
03:46:39,199 --> 03:46:41,920
agency in 2025 by generating consistent

7315
03:46:41,920 --> 03:46:45,600
leads. So the whole process of of lead

7316
03:46:45,600 --> 03:46:47,199
generation and I mean the the entire

7317
03:46:47,199 --> 03:46:49,279
client acquisition part of a business is

7318
03:46:49,279 --> 03:46:52,239
to turn strangers into customers, right?

7319
03:46:52,239 --> 03:46:53,760
So that's like the whole thing.

7320
03:46:53,760 --> 03:46:56,160
Stranger, never heard of you before to

7321
03:46:56,160 --> 03:46:59,600
customer. So we can call these cold,

7322
03:46:59,600 --> 03:47:01,520
these people are cold, right? They have

7323
03:47:01,520 --> 03:47:04,080
different um temperatures. You have cold

7324
03:47:04,080 --> 03:47:06,920
and then people will call it

7325
03:47:06,920 --> 03:47:09,680
warm and then you can call it hot. So

7326
03:47:09,680 --> 03:47:10,800
these are different audience

7327
03:47:10,800 --> 03:47:13,520
temperatures. And this is pretty

7328
03:47:13,520 --> 03:47:17,279
fundamental marketing uh terminology.

7329
03:47:17,279 --> 03:47:18,880
Cold audiences, never heard of you

7330
03:47:18,880 --> 03:47:20,960
before. Warm audiences, people who have

7331
03:47:20,960 --> 03:47:22,319
heard things before, maybe they've been

7332
03:47:22,319 --> 03:47:23,600
referred to you or they've engaged with

7333
03:47:23,600 --> 03:47:24,800
your content before, they've given you

7334
03:47:24,800 --> 03:47:26,560
the email, etc. They're warm. They've

7335
03:47:26,560 --> 03:47:28,160
taken some kind of they're no longer

7336
03:47:28,160 --> 03:47:30,000
strangers. And hot are people who are

7337
03:47:30,000 --> 03:47:32,239
showing extreme or like serious buying

7338
03:47:32,239 --> 03:47:35,199
intent and they are likely closable if

7339
03:47:35,199 --> 03:47:37,040
you make the right offer or get in front

7340
03:47:37,040 --> 03:47:38,399
of them in the right way. So that's

7341
03:47:38,399 --> 03:47:40,479
first things first. So up here, this

7342
03:47:40,479 --> 03:47:42,479
represents all the strangers. And so

7343
03:47:42,479 --> 03:47:44,640
when you are trying to market your your

7344
03:47:44,640 --> 03:47:46,319
business or regardless of if it's AI

7345
03:47:46,319 --> 03:47:48,000
automation agency or other you have

7346
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:49,840
these strangers and what content allows

7347
03:47:49,840 --> 03:47:51,920
you to do and this is being an organic

7348
03:47:51,920 --> 03:47:54,239
content funnel I think that that term

7349
03:47:54,239 --> 03:47:56,239
was coined by Matt Gray um and he's done

7350
03:47:56,239 --> 03:47:58,319
a lot lot of stuff in sort of explaining

7351
03:47:58,319 --> 03:48:00,080
how this organic content funnel works

7352
03:48:00,080 --> 03:48:01,439
and it's been very helpful for me to

7353
03:48:01,439 --> 03:48:03,279
understand what I've been doing all

7354
03:48:03,279 --> 03:48:04,880
along and and putting into a bit more of

7355
03:48:04,880 --> 03:48:07,439
a a framework like this. So shout out to

7356
03:48:07,439 --> 03:48:09,760
Matt great for that.

7357
03:48:09,760 --> 03:48:10,800
What we're trying to do is turn these

7358
03:48:10,800 --> 03:48:12,720
changes into into these are book

7359
03:48:12,720 --> 03:48:14,399
meetings. Let's call these bookings on

7360
03:48:14,399 --> 03:48:15,720
your

7361
03:48:15,720 --> 03:48:19,239
calendar and these are

7362
03:48:19,239 --> 03:48:21,199
closes. The first thing you need to do

7363
03:48:21,199 --> 03:48:24,160
when it comes to content is to get

7364
03:48:24,160 --> 03:48:26,160
awareness. Right? The first problem is

7365
03:48:26,160 --> 03:48:30,000
let's write this up here. Problem

7366
03:48:32,279 --> 03:48:35,840
one is awareness. No one even knows who

7367
03:48:35,840 --> 03:48:39,080
you are.

7368
03:48:39,120 --> 03:48:40,880
And awareness step is taking these

7369
03:48:40,880 --> 03:48:42,160
strangers and putting them into this

7370
03:48:42,160 --> 03:48:46,199
first one. So we can say this is

7371
03:48:46,199 --> 03:48:48,479
going and converting them into this

7372
03:48:48,479 --> 03:48:50,960
little one. So the thing with content is

7373
03:48:50,960 --> 03:48:52,720
that certain platforms have

7374
03:48:52,720 --> 03:48:54,239
discoverability engines. Like say here

7375
03:48:54,239 --> 03:48:57,040
on YouTube, if you make content that is

7376
03:48:57,040 --> 03:48:59,840
talking about how uh builders can use AI

7377
03:48:59,840 --> 03:49:02,800
or the best real estate AI systems,

7378
03:49:02,800 --> 03:49:04,319
YouTube has an algorithm that allows you

7379
03:49:04,319 --> 03:49:06,399
to be discovered. So it'll try to find

7380
03:49:06,399 --> 03:49:08,560
people or either through YouTube search

7381
03:49:08,560 --> 03:49:10,479
or uh just being recommended on their on

7382
03:49:10,479 --> 03:49:13,279
their brows that will try to convert or

7383
03:49:13,279 --> 03:49:15,040
at least show those videos to these

7384
03:49:15,040 --> 03:49:17,760
strangers and if you are appealing to

7385
03:49:17,760 --> 03:49:19,120
what those strangers are interested in

7386
03:49:19,120 --> 03:49:20,800
say these are these are red dots might

7387
03:49:20,800 --> 03:49:22,319
be your builders right and this is just

7388
03:49:22,319 --> 03:49:23,520
the millions of people on these

7389
03:49:23,520 --> 03:49:25,920
platforms. There are red dots in that

7390
03:49:25,920 --> 03:49:27,600
audience. You just need to be able to

7391
03:49:27,600 --> 03:49:30,479
attract them and convert that uh convert

7392
03:49:30,479 --> 03:49:32,560
them from strangers into people who are

7393
03:49:32,560 --> 03:49:34,399
aware of you. So this is the uh

7394
03:49:34,399 --> 03:49:36,080
awareness problem and the way you do

7395
03:49:36,080 --> 03:49:37,840
this is by making content that is

7396
03:49:37,840 --> 03:49:39,800
targeted to a certain group of people.

7397
03:49:39,800 --> 03:49:42,960
So top five AI automations for builders

7398
03:49:42,960 --> 03:49:46,319
in 2025. Simple like just more ideas

7399
03:49:46,319 --> 03:49:48,000
like that. And this goes for the same

7400
03:49:48,000 --> 03:49:50,080
thing for if you're posting on LinkedIn

7401
03:49:50,080 --> 03:49:52,319
or if you're posting on X etc. But you

7402
03:49:52,319 --> 03:49:53,439
need to solve this first problem of

7403
03:49:53,439 --> 03:49:54,960
awareness and that's done through

7404
03:49:54,960 --> 03:49:56,479
creating content and posting on

7405
03:49:56,479 --> 03:49:57,600
platforms that allow you to be

7406
03:49:57,600 --> 03:49:59,680
discovered. So and Tik Tok is a great

7407
03:49:59,680 --> 03:50:00,960
example of this because they were the

7408
03:50:00,960 --> 03:50:03,040
first ones. Uh if you go back a few

7409
03:50:03,040 --> 03:50:04,960
years before we had reals on Instagram,

7410
03:50:04,960 --> 03:50:06,960
if you made a new Instagram account and

7411
03:50:06,960 --> 03:50:08,319
you started posting the most amazing

7412
03:50:08,319 --> 03:50:10,160
content ever, but you had no followers,

7413
03:50:10,160 --> 03:50:11,600
you weren't going to get any any

7414
03:50:11,600 --> 03:50:12,720
engagement because there's no

7415
03:50:12,720 --> 03:50:14,640
discoverability. You're not getting

7416
03:50:14,640 --> 03:50:16,800
yourself in front of anyone new. So this

7417
03:50:16,800 --> 03:50:18,479
is when for you pages and stuff like

7418
03:50:18,479 --> 03:50:20,080
that were popularized through

7419
03:50:20,080 --> 03:50:22,399
popularized through Tik Tok and uh

7420
03:50:22,399 --> 03:50:24,000
Instagram of course with that and

7421
03:50:24,000 --> 03:50:25,199
YouTube's always been kind of a

7422
03:50:25,199 --> 03:50:27,840
discoverability engine like that. So, if

7423
03:50:27,840 --> 03:50:29,760
you want to solve this first problem of

7424
03:50:29,760 --> 03:50:31,439
turning strangers into into paying

7425
03:50:31,439 --> 03:50:32,960
customers, you need to think about how

7426
03:50:32,960 --> 03:50:34,640
you solve this awareness thing. And

7427
03:50:34,640 --> 03:50:35,840
that's going to be done through using a

7428
03:50:35,840 --> 03:50:37,600
platform like YouTube or through

7429
03:50:37,600 --> 03:50:40,399
Instagram reels or whatever where they

7430
03:50:40,399 --> 03:50:41,840
have an engine that can allow you to be

7431
03:50:41,840 --> 03:50:42,880
shown to people who are not your

7432
03:50:42,880 --> 03:50:44,080
followers. Otherwise, you're going to

7433
03:50:44,080 --> 03:50:45,600
have a much harder time. Say if you

7434
03:50:45,600 --> 03:50:46,880
started a new Twitter account and you

7435
03:50:46,880 --> 03:50:48,720
got zero followers. I believe they may

7436
03:50:48,720 --> 03:50:50,720
be incorporating more of a a

7437
03:50:50,720 --> 03:50:53,120
discoverability engine into Twitter. Um,

7438
03:50:53,120 --> 03:50:54,800
yeah, I think there's people you follow

7439
03:50:54,800 --> 03:50:57,040
and then like general posts as well. So

7440
03:50:57,040 --> 03:50:58,800
it seems like they have integrated that

7441
03:50:58,800 --> 03:51:00,560
as well. But that's the first problem is

7442
03:51:00,560 --> 03:51:03,120
getting them across here and these guys

7443
03:51:03,120 --> 03:51:05,840
to see your content and ideally follow

7444
03:51:05,840 --> 03:51:07,439
you. So I'm going to say this first step

7445
03:51:07,439 --> 03:51:09,279
from completely cold into this sort of

7446
03:51:09,279 --> 03:51:13,000
warm area. These are people who have

7447
03:51:13,000 --> 03:51:14,840
um

7448
03:51:14,840 --> 03:51:19,239
seen your content

7449
03:51:20,080 --> 03:51:22,439
um followed

7450
03:51:22,439 --> 03:51:25,399
you

7451
03:51:25,399 --> 03:51:26,880
followed/subscribed and this is

7452
03:51:26,880 --> 03:51:28,319
basically victory number one for you.

7453
03:51:28,319 --> 03:51:31,040
Have you made something that is

7454
03:51:31,040 --> 03:51:32,560
appealing to the people that you're

7455
03:51:32,560 --> 03:51:34,479
trying to find and it's converted them

7456
03:51:34,479 --> 03:51:35,840
from a stranger, it's gotten them to

7457
03:51:35,840 --> 03:51:38,080
click or to stop scrolling and they've

7458
03:51:38,080 --> 03:51:39,439
watched your content and ideally they've

7459
03:51:39,439 --> 03:51:40,800
followed your subscribe. So, this puts

7460
03:51:40,800 --> 03:51:42,960
them in kind of the holding bay of like,

7461
03:51:42,960 --> 03:51:44,720
okay, now I get a chance to keep sending

7462
03:51:44,720 --> 03:51:47,680
more sending more uh value and passing

7463
03:51:47,680 --> 03:51:49,040
more value that way through my posts,

7464
03:51:49,040 --> 03:51:51,600
right? So, um you can be found on on

7465
03:51:51,600 --> 03:51:53,040
YouTube and they subscribe to you. And

7466
03:51:53,040 --> 03:51:54,319
the way YouTube works is that it's going

7467
03:51:54,319 --> 03:51:55,840
to provide it's going to push those

7468
03:51:55,840 --> 03:51:58,479
videos onto their uh their browse page

7469
03:51:58,479 --> 03:52:00,239
and also in the subscriptions tab. But

7470
03:52:00,239 --> 03:52:01,279
the main thing is that if you're

7471
03:52:01,279 --> 03:52:02,640
subscribed to someone, like many of you

7472

03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:33,319
straight up with you all about things.

7488
03:52:33,319 --> 03:52:36,000
Um, but yeah, I just appreciate you all

7489
03:52:36,000 --> 03:52:37,439
for for everything you've done for me

7490
03:52:37,439 --> 03:52:39,279
and my team and stuff like that, but I

7491
03:52:39,279 --> 03:52:41,199
don't want to get all mushy on you, but

7492
03:52:41,199 --> 03:52:43,439
um allow me to do this stuff and this is

7493
03:52:43,439 --> 03:52:46,880
what I love. So, so your content and

7494
03:52:46,880 --> 03:52:48,399
you've solved that problem. So, problem

7495
03:52:48,399 --> 03:52:51,120
number one, awareness is solved and that

7496
03:52:51,120 --> 03:52:52,319
is they've got you've got them on some

7497
03:52:52,319 --> 03:52:53,439
kind of holding platform. Now, the

7498
03:52:53,439 --> 03:52:55,040
important thing to understand here is

7499
03:52:55,040 --> 03:52:56,479
that this these are called rented

7500
03:52:56,479 --> 03:52:59,279
audiences, right? These are bad. Well,

7501
03:52:59,279 --> 03:53:00,720
they they're better than cold. It's

7502
03:53:00,720 --> 03:53:02,319
obviously better than no one knowing you

7503
03:53:02,319 --> 03:53:05,920
exist, but these are

7504
03:53:08,040 --> 03:53:10,720
rented. These are rented audiences.

7505
03:53:10,720 --> 03:53:13,520
rented, meaning you are a guest on the

7506
03:53:13,520 --> 03:53:15,760
YouTube platform or you are a guest on

7507
03:53:15,760 --> 03:53:17,760
the X platform or whichever one you're

7508
03:53:17,760 --> 03:53:19,520
you're on. Basically, at any point, they

7509
03:53:19,520 --> 03:53:20,960
could turn the lights off of your

7510
03:53:20,960 --> 03:53:22,880
account. All of your access to them is

7511
03:53:22,880 --> 03:53:25,840
determined by the algorithm and by uh

7512
03:53:25,840 --> 03:53:27,199
staying within the bounds of of what's

7513
03:53:27,199 --> 03:53:28,399
allowed on that platform. So, it's

7514
03:53:28,399 --> 03:53:30,239
rented. While this is good, you can have

7515
03:53:30,239 --> 03:53:32,319
like Oh, I'm just going to ditch these

7516
03:53:32,319 --> 03:53:35,120
down here. By the way, you could have

7517
03:53:35,120 --> 03:53:38,080
10,000 followers or you make content

7518
03:53:38,080 --> 03:53:39,680
that allows you over the course of a few

7519
03:53:39,680 --> 03:53:42,239
months. you eventually g 10,000

7520
03:53:42,239 --> 03:53:44,000
followers, 10,000 people who want to be

7521
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:45,760
basically subscribed to see more content

7522
03:53:45,760 --> 03:53:48,720
like that. Um, and this can also be done

7523
03:53:48,720 --> 03:53:50,800
through what's called a CTA. So, this is

7524
03:53:50,800 --> 03:53:52,960
a bit more marketing CTA, call to

7525
03:53:52,960 --> 03:53:55,920
action. Say in this video, I could say

7526
03:53:55,920 --> 03:53:57,680
if you enjoy this kind of content and

7527
03:53:57,680 --> 03:53:59,120
you want to learn how to build AI

7528
03:53:59,120 --> 03:54:01,040
businesses and and make an impact in the

7529
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:04,239
world and uh see the the best version of

7530
03:54:04,239 --> 03:54:05,600
yourself through this awesome vehicle,

7531
03:54:05,600 --> 03:54:06,880
then subscribe to the channel. See, I

7532
03:54:06,880 --> 03:54:08,960
just did a that's called a CTA. So, I

7533
03:54:08,960 --> 03:54:10,399
just did a call to action to get you to

7534
03:54:10,399 --> 03:54:12,000
subscribe to the the channel so that you

7535
03:54:12,000 --> 03:54:13,600
see more content like this. Pretty basic

7536
03:54:13,600 --> 03:54:15,279
stuff, I know. Um, but you can do this

7537
03:54:15,279 --> 03:54:17,439
in written content as well. So, the CTA

7538
03:54:17,439 --> 03:54:19,359
here would be, hey, subscribe to me for

7539
03:54:19,359 --> 03:54:20,720
more content like this, which is what I

7540
03:54:20,720 --> 03:54:22,160
just said to you. And hopefully some of

7541
03:54:22,160 --> 03:54:23,640
you have subscribed if you haven't

7542
03:54:23,640 --> 03:54:25,680
already. And this is how you get your

7543
03:54:25,680 --> 03:54:28,080
your followers or whatever the the

7544
03:54:28,080 --> 03:54:30,279
platform specific one is. And

7545
03:54:30,279 --> 03:54:32,720
then we need to convert these rented

7546
03:54:32,720 --> 03:54:34,880
audiences which is good to have but

7547
03:54:34,880 --> 03:54:37,600
still not uh not what you really want um

7548
03:54:37,600 --> 03:54:39,439
and can be taken away at any point as we

7549
03:54:39,439 --> 03:54:41,520
saw through I know the whole co thing

7550
03:54:41,520 --> 03:54:42,720
certain people getting completely taken

7551
03:54:42,720 --> 03:54:44,479
off and and various different platforms

7552
03:54:44,479 --> 03:54:46,080
if you say the wrong thing you're gone.

7553
03:54:46,080 --> 03:54:47,439
So if you're running a business you want

7554
03:54:47,439 --> 03:54:50,720
to have diversified or definitely

7555
03:54:50,720 --> 03:54:52,239
factored in that risk that you could get

7556
03:54:52,239 --> 03:54:54,239
nuked at any point. And so this is when

7557
03:54:54,239 --> 03:54:57,279
we get into what's called um this blue

7558
03:54:57,279 --> 03:54:59,479
one doesn't work that well. Oh,

7559
03:54:59,479 --> 03:55:05,358
sorry. A red a red tick uh of owned

7560
03:55:07,000 --> 03:55:09,120
audiences. Now, this is the really

7561
03:55:09,120 --> 03:55:10,880
really really important thing. So, say

7562
03:55:10,880 --> 03:55:12,319
we're doing the building example and

7563
03:55:12,319 --> 03:55:13,760
we've gone and we've got we've managed

7564
03:55:13,760 --> 03:55:14,960
to pull a bunch of builders out. We've

7565
03:55:14,960 --> 03:55:16,720
made some really good stuff that appeals

7566
03:55:16,720 --> 03:55:18,239
to builders on YouTube or maybe you've

7567
03:55:18,239 --> 03:55:19,600
gone on Instagram cuz you realize that

7568
03:55:19,600 --> 03:55:21,199
Instagram is a better platform for

7569
03:55:21,199 --> 03:55:22,800
finding builders. Um that is something

7570
03:55:22,800 --> 03:55:24,399
you need to factor in if you are doing a

7571
03:55:24,399 --> 03:55:26,960
content system like this. Um, if you're

7572
03:55:26,960 --> 03:55:29,279
trying to find a certain type of person,

7573
03:55:29,279 --> 03:55:30,439
it's like,

7574
03:55:30,439 --> 03:55:33,600
would Seale execs be watching YouTube

7575
03:55:33,600 --> 03:55:34,960
and picking around? I'm sure there's

7576
03:55:34,960 --> 03:55:36,479
some, but you need to make sure you're

7577
03:55:36,479 --> 03:55:37,680
using the right platform to find the

7578
03:55:37,680 --> 03:55:41,880
right people. So, that's a that's an

7579
03:55:41,880 --> 03:55:44,160
ideal line of getting awareness with my

7580
03:55:44,160 --> 03:55:45,840
content that YouTube has served to these

7581
03:55:45,840 --> 03:55:48,399
builders or they found it through the

7582
03:55:48,399 --> 03:55:50,399
search engine like top automations for

7583
03:55:50,399 --> 03:55:52,880
builders or like five things every

7584
03:55:52,880 --> 03:55:55,239
builder should know about AI moving.

7585
03:55:55,239 --> 03:55:57,680
Y and so we've got them in this rented

7586
03:55:57,680 --> 03:55:59,920
audience. Now we need to try and move um

7587
03:55:59,920 --> 03:56:02,600
so let's say this is all full of

7588
03:56:02,600 --> 03:56:05,040
them. We now need to try to move some of

7589
03:56:05,040 --> 03:56:06,279
them across

7590
03:56:06,279 --> 03:56:09,040
this and into our rented audience. Now

7591
03:56:09,040 --> 03:56:12,640
what is a rented audience? Typically um

7592
03:56:12,640 --> 03:56:14,880
general marketing is just the email. Can

7593
03:56:14,880 --> 03:56:19,399
you get their email? So this is there's

7594
03:56:19,399 --> 03:56:22,199
email and then there's

7595
03:56:22,199 --> 03:56:24,239
SMS and then obviously there's like

7596
03:56:24,239 --> 03:56:25,439
WhatsApp and any other things but

7597
03:56:25,439 --> 03:56:28,880
basically you can I mean WhatsApp also

7598
03:56:28,880 --> 03:56:30,239
could WhatsApp you're still technically

7599
03:56:30,239 --> 03:56:31,359
using their platforms and you could be

7600
03:56:31,359 --> 03:56:33,600
banned. So email and SMS are kind of

7601
03:56:33,600 --> 03:56:35,600
permissionless. You do need to obviously

7602
03:56:35,600 --> 03:56:38,080
stick within the the realm of uh good

7603
03:56:38,080 --> 03:56:39,680
email practices to not get banned and

7604
03:56:39,680 --> 03:56:42,560
also uh SMS to your list should be fine.

7605
03:56:42,560 --> 03:56:44,000
Yeah, there's basically nothing at least

7606
03:56:44,000 --> 03:56:45,840
you're spamming them. But basically you

7607
03:56:45,840 --> 03:56:47,199
have their number, you have their email

7608
03:56:47,199 --> 03:56:48,880
and you can communicate with them

7609
03:56:48,880 --> 03:56:51,120
whenever you want and however you want

7610
03:56:51,120 --> 03:56:53,120
until unless you make them unsubscribe.

7611
03:56:53,120 --> 03:56:55,680
Um but that the point is that you have

7612
03:56:55,680 --> 03:56:57,120
control over it. They have opted in

7613
03:56:57,120 --> 03:56:59,359
given you their their details so that

7614
03:56:59,359 --> 03:57:00,640
you have permission to contact them. And

7615
03:57:00,640 --> 03:57:03,000
the most important thing about business

7616
03:57:03,000 --> 03:57:05,760
um maybe uh definitely one of the most

7617
03:57:05,760 --> 03:57:06,960
important things is being able to

7618
03:57:06,960 --> 03:57:08,479
communicate directly to your customer

7619
03:57:08,479 --> 03:57:10,960
base. And if you think about it, if you

7620
03:57:10,960 --> 03:57:13,920
send an email out to a 10,000 person

7621
03:57:13,920 --> 03:57:16,479
email list, you might get 30 to 40% of

7622
03:57:16,479 --> 03:57:18,239
those opening. So even then when you've

7623
03:57:18,239 --> 03:57:20,000
got their email only and then how many

7624
03:57:20,000 --> 03:57:21,439
of them actually read the whole thing?

7625
03:57:21,439 --> 03:57:22,960
So then that's when you realize how

7626
03:57:22,960 --> 03:57:26,960
difficult it truly is to to like get a

7627
03:57:26,960 --> 03:57:28,560
little bit of the brain space of all the

7628
03:57:28,560 --> 03:57:29,760
people you're trying to work with. So

7629
03:57:29,760 --> 03:57:30,880
whether that's you're hitting them with

7630
03:57:30,880 --> 03:57:32,399
with lots of content all over the place

7631
03:57:32,399 --> 03:57:34,080
and hitting them with emails, even with

7632
03:57:34,080 --> 03:57:35,600
all of that noise and all of that value

7633
03:57:35,600 --> 03:57:36,960
you're throwing at them, it's still

7634
03:57:36,960 --> 03:57:38,560
quite hard to get through to them.

7635
03:57:38,560 --> 03:57:40,560
That's why having a direct line to them

7636
03:57:40,560 --> 03:57:42,000
is such a valuable thing. And that's why

7637
03:57:42,000 --> 03:57:43,760
it's important to try to get an owned

7638
03:57:43,760 --> 03:57:45,840
audience. So, the way you do this, um,

7639
03:57:45,840 --> 03:57:47,199
and I'm even going to show you how to do

7640
03:57:47,199 --> 03:57:48,479
it with this video because I'm I'm going

7641
03:57:48,479 --> 03:57:49,920
to attach the the free resource with

7642
03:57:49,920 --> 03:57:51,680
this for you guys to to build out your

7643
03:57:51,680 --> 03:57:53,600
own uh your own organic content funnel

7644
03:57:53,600 --> 03:57:56,080
like this. But, you need some kind of

7645
03:57:56,080 --> 03:57:58,479
value or CTA or something. And a lot of

7646
03:57:58,479 --> 03:58:00,239
the people in my accelerator to do this

7647
03:58:00,239 --> 03:58:02,479
um are doing very very well at LinkedIn.

7648
03:58:02,479 --> 03:58:05,439
I'll try to um put a couple of the

7649
03:58:05,439 --> 03:58:07,040
LinkedIn profiles of them down there if

7650
03:58:07,040 --> 03:58:09,760
I can if I can find some good bots. Um

7651
03:58:09,760 --> 03:58:12,359
but basically they're doing content that

7652
03:58:12,359 --> 03:58:14,560
is getting people to engage with it's

7653
03:58:14,560 --> 03:58:16,640
like hey these these 20 make automations

7654
03:58:16,640 --> 03:58:19,239
do automate your business in

7655
03:58:19,239 --> 03:58:21,520
2025 kind of broad things and you have

7656
03:58:21,520 --> 03:58:23,680
like a a Loom video showing this make

7657
03:58:23,680 --> 03:58:26,239
automation and fairly fairly standard. I

7658
03:58:26,239 --> 03:58:27,520
feel like I feel like we haven't made it

7659
03:58:27,520 --> 03:58:29,120
standard on on LinkedIn because of how

7660
03:58:29,120 --> 03:58:30,160
much we're pushing it in the

7661
03:58:30,160 --> 03:58:31,600
accelerator, but you guys probably see

7662
03:58:31,600 --> 03:58:33,840
it all the time. If you don't, then hop

7663
03:58:33,840 --> 03:58:35,760
on LinkedIn and follow a couple AI

7664
03:58:35,760 --> 03:58:37,279
automation agency owners and you

7665
03:58:37,279 --> 03:58:38,880
definitely see a lot of it. But

7666
03:58:38,880 --> 03:58:40,960
something that you make some content on

7667
03:58:40,960 --> 03:58:43,199
here uh on say LinkedIn or YouTube or

7668
03:58:43,199 --> 03:58:45,120
whatever and then you attach to it some

7669
03:58:45,120 --> 03:58:47,720
kind of offer. So, another

7670
03:58:47,720 --> 03:58:50,080
CTA saying, "Hey, if you enjoyed this,

7671
03:58:50,080 --> 03:58:51,600
I've actually got even more value or

7672
03:58:51,600 --> 03:58:53,520
even more stuff to give you, and I'm

7673
03:58:53,520 --> 03:58:55,359
going to put it um just behind this

7674
03:58:55,359 --> 03:58:56,319
thing where you have to give me your

7675
03:58:56,319 --> 03:58:59,199
email." And so, that step is getting

7676
03:58:59,199 --> 03:59:03,640
them into say uh email

7677
03:59:03,640 --> 03:59:05,600
list. And so, of course, you can just

7678
03:59:05,600 --> 03:59:06,960
say sign up to my newsletter, but

7679
03:59:06,960 --> 03:59:08,479
there's not much value behind that. So,

7680
03:59:08,479 --> 03:59:10,319
I mean, use an example of of what I've

7681
03:59:10,319 --> 03:59:11,520
literally given to you guys in this

7682
03:59:11,520 --> 03:59:14,279
video. Um, it's a

7683
03:59:14,279 --> 03:59:16,600
free

7684
03:59:16,600 --> 03:59:20,399
resource, what's called a lead

7685
03:59:21,160 --> 03:59:25,040
magnet. Um, and that CTA is going to

7686
03:59:25,040 --> 03:59:26,880
take them from this audience here, the

7687
03:59:26,880 --> 03:59:28,000
rental audience, into your owned

7688
03:59:28,000 --> 03:59:29,520
audience where you have the email or

7689
03:59:29,520 --> 03:59:32,800
SMS. And now in here is an important

7690
03:59:32,800 --> 03:59:35,680
mechanism um that is is probably one of

7691
03:59:35,680 --> 03:59:38,080
the lesser understood ones in in the

7692
03:59:38,080 --> 03:59:40,239
entire sort of marketing space. And this

7693
03:59:40,239 --> 03:59:41,439
is something that took me quite a while

7694
03:59:41,439 --> 03:59:43,199
to to realize as well. So there's

7695
03:59:43,199 --> 03:59:46,000
another very very important stage and

7696
03:59:46,000 --> 03:59:46,840
it's

7697
03:59:46,840 --> 03:59:49,840
called

7698
03:59:53,080 --> 03:59:56,160
nurturing. And this is what happens in

7699
03:59:56,160 --> 03:59:58,239
this section here. I mean it's

7700
03:59:58,239 --> 04:00:00,000
technically happening here but nurturing

7701
04:00:00,000 --> 04:00:01,680
is basically just building up sort of

7702
04:00:01,680 --> 04:00:03,920
trust

7703
04:00:03,920 --> 04:00:08,720
um respect all those loveydvey words.

7704
04:00:08,720 --> 04:00:12,000
um uh authority and just like this we do

7705
04:00:12,000 --> 04:00:14,080
it at at Morningside AI with our uh with

7706
04:00:14,080 --> 04:00:15,600
our customer list and they like the

7707
04:00:15,600 --> 04:00:16,800
people that would be on sales calls that

7708
04:00:16,800 --> 04:00:18,720
we would like to close uh at a later

7709
04:00:18,720 --> 04:00:21,120
date. Um the exact same process works

7710
04:00:21,120 --> 04:00:23,120
for uh say education businesses like

7711
04:00:23,120 --> 04:00:25,680
like the the AAA accelerator IRM and

7712
04:00:25,680 --> 04:00:27,199
more for you guys is doing the exact

7713
04:00:27,199 --> 04:00:28,720
same thing for nurturing your AI

7714
04:00:28,720 --> 04:00:31,279
automation agency leads. Um, so

7715
04:00:31,279 --> 04:00:34,160
nurturing is is a key step and it can be

7716
04:00:34,160 --> 04:00:35,680
done through content whether like you

7717
04:00:35,680 --> 04:00:37,040
guys watch my channel right now. If you

7718
04:00:37,040 --> 04:00:38,640
guys have a YouTube channel, you

7719
04:00:38,640 --> 04:00:39,920
technically nurture them, but what you

7720
04:00:39,920 --> 04:00:42,080
can do is you can run emails to push

7721
04:00:42,080 --> 04:00:44,399
them out of your list to watch the video

7722
04:00:44,399 --> 04:00:46,399
and that continues to prove your

7723
04:00:46,399 --> 04:00:48,319
expertise, build a relationship with

7724
04:00:48,319 --> 04:00:49,920
them. They say you need like seven touch

7725
04:00:49,920 --> 04:00:51,920
points on average these days in order to

7726
04:00:51,920 --> 04:00:53,680
sell something. And so if you guys are

7727
04:00:53,680 --> 04:00:54,359
trying

7728
04:00:54,359 --> 04:00:57,680
to convert these builders, okay, we're

7729
04:00:57,680 --> 04:00:58,960
using the builders, bought these

7730
04:00:58,960 --> 04:01:01,520
builders into people who are uh booked

7731
04:01:01,520 --> 04:01:03,199
onto your calendar. So this is this is

7732
04:01:03,199 --> 04:01:04,880
book these bookings that I come out the

7733
04:01:04,880 --> 04:01:06,479
second stage. Then you need to have some

7734
04:01:06,479 --> 04:01:07,760
way to prove that you know what you're

7735
04:01:07,760 --> 04:01:08,800
talking about, that you are someone that

7736
04:01:08,800 --> 04:01:09,720
they can

7737
04:01:09,720 --> 04:01:12,720
help. Then then you need to prove that

7738
04:01:12,720 --> 04:01:13,920
you are someone that can actually help

7739
04:01:13,920 --> 04:01:15,199
them to achieve what they want to

7740
04:01:15,199 --> 04:01:17,520
achieve. And that's the best case of

7741
04:01:17,520 --> 04:01:19,279
being their guide to better understand

7742
04:01:19,279 --> 04:01:21,520
AI and to use it to improve their

7743
04:01:21,520 --> 04:01:23,760
business. So this nurture step is is so

7744
04:01:23,760 --> 04:01:25,520
critical and that's why what it's really

7745
04:01:25,520 --> 04:01:26,880
important to get them into that that

7746
04:01:26,880 --> 04:01:28,319
owned audience because you get a chance

7747
04:01:28,319 --> 04:01:30,399
to consistently nurture them. Say the

7748
04:01:30,399 --> 04:01:32,800
the way you put this into your strategy

7749
04:01:32,800 --> 04:01:35,040
for the builders is once a week or twice

7750
04:01:35,040 --> 04:01:37,680
a week, you talk about one handy or

7751
04:01:37,680 --> 04:01:39,040
maybe like an interview that you did

7752
04:01:39,040 --> 04:01:40,640
with the client or a breakdown of a case

7753
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:43,120
study that you did or a a list of handy

7754
04:01:43,120 --> 04:01:44,239
tools or things that they should look

7755
04:01:44,239 --> 04:01:47,120
into or a you there's so many different

7756
04:01:47,120 --> 04:01:48,479
ways that you can prove that you know

7757
04:01:48,479 --> 04:01:49,680
what you're talking about or or that

7758
04:01:49,680 --> 04:01:51,359
you've like an interesting story that

7759
04:01:51,359 --> 04:01:52,960
that you had when you're working with a

7760
04:01:52,960 --> 04:01:54,800
client recently. this kind of stuff and

7761
04:01:54,800 --> 04:01:56,160
providing free value and and really

7762
04:01:56,160 --> 04:01:57,920
writing a story of how you want them to

7763
04:01:57,920 --> 04:02:00,160
perceive you is critical. Maybe you did

7764
04:02:00,160 --> 04:02:01,680
a did a podcast or an interview with

7765
04:02:01,680 --> 04:02:03,040
someone and you shoot that out to email

7766
04:02:03,040 --> 04:02:04,960
list. Hey guys, just had a chat with a

7767
04:02:04,960 --> 04:02:07,080
one of the biggest uh

7768
04:02:07,080 --> 04:02:09,600
building building contracting firms in

7769
04:02:09,600 --> 04:02:12,880
my my city and with the CEO and we walk

7770
04:02:12,880 --> 04:02:14,319
through this this this and you ship it

7771
04:02:14,319 --> 04:02:16,239
out to email list. Basically, at some

7772
04:02:16,239 --> 04:02:18,319
point they would be like, "Wow, this guy

7773
04:02:18,319 --> 04:02:20,319
is the person that I need to to work

7774
04:02:20,319 --> 04:02:22,239
with to get what I want to get done."

7775
04:02:22,239 --> 04:02:25,600
And that's when you make the final

7776
04:02:27,560 --> 04:02:33,920
CTA. And this is going to be to um your

7777
04:02:33,960 --> 04:02:36,239
calendar. And so at the end of all of

7778
04:02:36,239 --> 04:02:37,439
these these nurture steps when you're

7779
04:02:37,439 --> 04:02:39,040
shooting out email, shooting out emails,

7780
04:02:39,040 --> 04:02:40,800
you include at the end of that email or

7781
04:02:40,800 --> 04:02:43,439
the SMS or they're just going to be the

7782
04:02:43,439 --> 04:02:44,640
email most of the most time it's going

7783
04:02:44,640 --> 04:02:46,479
to be your email and newsletter. Um and

7784
04:02:46,479 --> 04:02:48,000
there's going to be CTA's like, "Hey, by

7785
04:02:48,000 --> 04:02:49,279
the way, I've actually just opened up a

7786
04:02:49,279 --> 04:02:50,640
few more spots. we've just got this

7787
04:02:50,640 --> 04:02:52,479
great result for XYZ. That's what was in

7788
04:02:52,479 --> 04:02:54,399
the email. A breakdown of a client case

7789
04:02:54,399 --> 04:02:55,359
study or something you've been working

7790
04:02:55,359 --> 04:02:57,279
on recently or or a learning that you

7791
04:02:57,279 --> 04:02:59,520
had. Is that by the way, I've also got a

7792
04:02:59,520 --> 04:03:01,359
a few spaces opened up on my calendar.

7793
04:03:01,359 --> 04:03:02,800
Um we're taking on a few more clients

7794
04:03:02,800 --> 04:03:04,560
for next month. Put a bit of urgency and

7795
04:03:04,560 --> 04:03:05,760
scarcity in there. We find out that

7796
04:03:05,760 --> 04:03:07,520
morning side that's always always great.

7797
04:03:07,520 --> 04:03:10,560
Um I mean you can fabricate it, but I

7798
04:03:10,560 --> 04:03:12,720
mean it's we we don't need to fabricate

7799
04:03:12,720 --> 04:03:14,000
it because because we actually have it,

7800
04:03:14,000 --> 04:03:16,000
but it would before we needed before we

7801
04:03:16,000 --> 04:03:18,160
were at the safe. Um we did need to

7802
04:03:18,160 --> 04:03:19,199
fabricate it. So, if you need to

7803
04:03:19,199 --> 04:03:21,760
fabricate scarcity and urgency, but you

7804
04:03:21,760 --> 04:03:23,760
guys just being absolutely packed out, I

7805
04:03:23,760 --> 04:03:25,120
mean, we had to do it when we first got

7806
04:03:25,120 --> 04:03:26,720
started. Uh, I don't think it's it's

7807
04:03:26,720 --> 04:03:29,279
illegal by any means. Um, but a bit of

7808
04:03:29,279 --> 04:03:30,479
urgency and scarcity is great to get

7809
04:03:30,479 --> 04:03:32,319
them to make that jump and book a call.

7810
04:03:32,319 --> 04:03:34,399
And so, here is when we start getting

7811
04:03:34,399 --> 04:03:36,000
those infinite leads and bookings

7812
04:03:36,000 --> 04:03:38,160
flowing out. And now this is going to be

7813
04:03:38,160 --> 04:03:40,720
far better compared to say a direct

7814
04:03:40,720 --> 04:03:42,160
response marketing method like cold

7815
04:03:42,160 --> 04:03:44,000
email where you're taking them from here

7816
04:03:44,000 --> 04:03:47,279
to here in you're trying to do it in

7817
04:03:47,279 --> 04:03:50,479
like a day or like maybe a few days if

7818
04:03:50,479 --> 04:03:51,600
you got if you've got the follow-up

7819
04:03:51,600 --> 04:03:53,760
sequence going but you see this is a lot

7820
04:03:53,760 --> 04:03:56,399
slower. So the direct response direct

7821
04:03:56,399 --> 04:03:59,279
response marketing is is um a a style of

7822
04:03:59,279 --> 04:04:00,399
marketing where you're very much focused

7823
04:04:00,399 --> 04:04:02,960
on fast ROI measurable results um and

7824
04:04:02,960 --> 04:04:04,319
always making very strong and clear

7825
04:04:04,319 --> 04:04:06,680
offers with urgency and scarcity etc.

7826
04:04:06,680 --> 04:04:09,600
Um, this is a a bit of a combination

7827
04:04:09,600 --> 04:04:10,880
because we've got these these direct

7828
04:04:10,880 --> 04:04:12,800
response style things where we're trying

7829
04:04:12,800 --> 04:04:14,720
to push and measure this conversion.

7830
04:04:14,720 --> 04:04:16,160
Okay, how many people are watching my

7831
04:04:16,160 --> 04:04:17,279
content and how many people are

7832
04:04:17,279 --> 04:04:18,640
subscribing to my email list? Okay,

7833
04:04:18,640 --> 04:04:20,319
that's a you're getting a a direct

7834
04:04:20,319 --> 04:04:22,080
response from that content, but more

7835
04:04:22,080 --> 04:04:25,439
broadly, this nurturing step becomes a

7836
04:04:25,439 --> 04:04:27,760
longer a longer time horizon where it's

7837
04:04:27,760 --> 04:04:29,840
not so much direct response and it's

7838
04:04:29,840 --> 04:04:32,479
more so, okay, how can I uh get as many

7839
04:04:32,479 --> 04:04:34,880
people in here and just over time just

7840
04:04:34,880 --> 04:04:36,000
pepper away at them. Some people are

7841
04:04:36,000 --> 04:04:37,680
going to take lower the numbers. Uh some

7842
04:04:37,680 --> 04:04:38,640
people are going to convert very

7843
04:04:38,640 --> 04:04:40,319
quickly. But if you get a good mix of

7844
04:04:40,319 --> 04:04:41,840
value that you give there and then also

7845
04:04:41,840 --> 04:04:44,160
offers like you can put in once a month

7846
04:04:44,160 --> 04:04:45,279
at the end of the month at the start of

7847
04:04:45,279 --> 04:04:46,960
the month and direct a rep offer to your

7848
04:04:46,960 --> 04:04:49,760
email list saying hey guys we have uh uh

7849
04:04:49,760 --> 04:04:51,680
just wrapped up three more projects and

7850
04:04:51,680 --> 04:04:53,680
uh we're actually taking on two more. So

7851
04:04:53,680 --> 04:04:55,199
um I'd love to work with another another

7852
04:04:55,199 --> 04:04:57,600
building company locally. Um you can

7853
04:04:57,600 --> 04:04:59,439
book in a call directly with me here. Um

7854
04:04:59,439 --> 04:05:00,720
we can have a chat about how we can help

7855
04:05:00,720 --> 04:05:02,279
your

7856
04:05:02,279 --> 04:05:05,520
business. So does that all make sense?

7857
04:05:05,520 --> 04:05:07,239
I know it might seem like a lot of work,

7858
04:05:07,239 --> 04:05:09,840
but the the biggest thing that uh you

7859
04:05:09,840 --> 04:05:11,920
guys were asking about in the the forums

7860
04:05:11,920 --> 04:05:14,239
I put out is this consistent lead

7861
04:05:14,239 --> 04:05:17,359
generation question. And yes, this seems

7862
04:05:17,359 --> 04:05:19,680
like a lot, but consistently acquiring

7863
04:05:19,680 --> 04:05:22,000
leads does take a lot of effort. It's

7864
04:05:22,000 --> 04:05:24,399
it's one like 80% of your job as the

7865
04:05:24,399 --> 04:05:26,080
founder in the early stage of the

7866
04:05:26,080 --> 04:05:27,600
business should be focused on. It's just

7867
04:05:27,600 --> 04:05:29,760
this this this like how can I make

7868
04:05:29,760 --> 04:05:31,840
myself more known? How can I take

7869
04:05:31,840 --> 04:05:33,760
strangers and make some kind of touch

7870
04:05:33,760 --> 04:05:35,439
point with them and then give them some

7871
04:05:35,439 --> 04:05:36,720
free value and get them on my email

7872
04:05:36,720 --> 04:05:39,680
list? So to bring this kind of down to

7873
04:05:39,680 --> 04:05:41,600
earth for you all. And like I said, this

7874
04:05:41,600 --> 04:05:43,680
sales portion after on your calendar is

7875
04:05:43,680 --> 04:05:45,040
a is a whole other story that I can

7876
04:05:45,040 --> 04:05:47,000
probably do in another video for you.

7877
04:05:47,000 --> 04:05:49,199
But you guys really need to get serious

7878
04:05:49,199 --> 04:05:52,000
about setting up something like this cuz

7879
04:05:52,000 --> 04:05:54,880
the time involvement content creation,

7880
04:05:54,880 --> 04:05:57,560
if you get it dialed in, uh you can be

7881
04:05:57,560 --> 04:06:00,640
doing 10 hours a week of of content

7882
04:06:00,640 --> 04:06:02,239
creation and where you focus and you sit

7883
04:06:02,239 --> 04:06:04,560
down for two mornings a week and you

7884
04:06:04,560 --> 04:06:05,760
just bang out some really valuable

7885
04:06:05,760 --> 04:06:07,120
stuff. You look back over your calendar,

7886
04:06:07,120 --> 04:06:08,319
there's all sorts of ideation

7887
04:06:08,319 --> 04:06:09,920
strategies. Um that's I can make a whole

7888
04:06:09,920 --> 04:06:11,520
other video on that. the exact ideation

7889
04:06:11,520 --> 04:06:13,680
strategies I used to come up with like

7890
04:06:13,680 --> 04:06:16,479
200 ideas for content in uh in a few

7891
04:06:16,479 --> 04:06:18,239
hours. But then you can schedule it up.

7892
04:06:18,239 --> 04:06:19,520
You can say, "Okay, I'm going to get a

7893
04:06:19,520 --> 04:06:20,720
content manager in or I'm just going to

7894
04:06:20,720 --> 04:06:23,359
schedule it out myself initially and be

7895
04:06:23,359 --> 04:06:25,120
consistently posting across just one

7896
04:06:25,120 --> 04:06:26,239
platform to start." That's what I

7897
04:06:26,239 --> 04:06:28,160
recommend and moving people through

7898
04:06:28,160 --> 04:06:30,000
these. You may not get them immediately

7899
04:06:30,000 --> 04:06:31,760
jumping over, but I see so many of you

7900
04:06:31,760 --> 04:06:33,359
doing like the real really the main

7901
04:06:33,359 --> 04:06:34,479
thing that I want to talk in this video

7902
04:06:34,479 --> 04:06:35,239
is

7903
04:06:35,239 --> 04:06:37,600
that so many of you are doing good stuff

7904
04:06:37,600 --> 04:06:39,960
on the content side and you're

7905
04:06:39,960 --> 04:06:42,239
getting you're getting engagement. I see

7906
04:06:42,239 --> 04:06:43,520
a lot of people in my accelerator in the

7907
04:06:43,520 --> 04:06:45,439
free school community um getting

7908
04:06:45,439 --> 04:06:47,600
engagement on the social post and lots

7909
04:06:47,600 --> 04:06:48,640
of people like, "Yeah, send me this,

7910
04:06:48,640 --> 04:06:50,479
send me that, send me that." But I don't

7911
04:06:50,479 --> 04:06:52,000
hear as much about it like, "Hey, yeah,

7912
04:06:52,000 --> 04:06:53,199
I'm just consistently closing these

7913
04:06:53,199 --> 04:06:54,800
deals." like I got a lot of interest but

7914
04:06:54,800 --> 04:06:57,199
I haven't seem to to convert that into

7915
04:06:57,199 --> 04:06:59,680
uh into as many clients I thought with

7916
04:06:59,680 --> 04:07:01,439
and the people who have figured it out

7917
04:07:01,439 --> 04:07:02,560
and the ones who are really scaling

7918
04:07:02,560 --> 04:07:04,080
their agencies right now have realized

7919
04:07:04,080 --> 04:07:06,080
that there's a step where yes you

7920
04:07:06,080 --> 04:07:07,920
provided value with your content. Now

7921
04:07:07,920 --> 04:07:10,000
you need to capture that and you need to

7922
04:07:10,000 --> 04:07:13,120
also schedule time each week to manage

7923
04:07:13,120 --> 04:07:15,199
this owned uh this owned audience so

7924
04:07:15,199 --> 04:07:16,640
that you've got your list and you're

7925
04:07:16,640 --> 04:07:18,319
consistently peppering them with value.

7926
04:07:18,319 --> 04:07:20,160
Even if it's just 100 people or 200

7927
04:07:20,160 --> 04:07:21,840
people initially, just start shipping

7928
04:07:21,840 --> 04:07:23,120
away and building that up because soon

7929
04:07:23,120 --> 04:07:25,359
enough you will have again if you just

7930
04:07:25,359 --> 04:07:27,760
stick to this for 6 12 months. If you

7931
04:07:27,760 --> 04:07:29,680
want to do building as a niche, again

7932
04:07:29,680 --> 04:07:31,279
any if you haven't watched my niching

7933
04:07:31,279 --> 04:07:32,800
video, I just did it. It's it really

7934
04:07:32,800 --> 04:07:34,080
breaks down the best way to find your

7935
04:07:34,080 --> 04:07:36,960
your perfect niche in 2025 and beyond.

7936
04:07:36,960 --> 04:07:39,120
This process is going to allow you to

7937
04:07:39,120 --> 04:07:40,720
consistently pull people from the

7938
04:07:40,720 --> 04:07:42,720
unaware and have no clue, the cold

7939
04:07:42,720 --> 04:07:44,560
audience who doesn't know who you are

7940
04:07:44,560 --> 04:07:46,720
down through these with consistent

7941
04:07:46,720 --> 04:07:49,199
content output and then consistent

7942
04:07:49,199 --> 04:07:50,880
newsletters as well. And so this is

7943
04:07:50,880 --> 04:07:53,840
exactly what I've done to generate uh

7944
04:07:53,840 --> 04:07:56,479
2,000 or or more leads morning through

7945
04:07:56,479 --> 04:07:57,520
my YouTube channel. It's probably more

7946
04:07:57,520 --> 04:08:00,479
like 3,000 out. Um and then also we've

7947
04:08:00,479 --> 04:08:01,840
got the all the people who book in a

7948
04:08:01,840 --> 04:08:04,399
call us. We add the email and we do fire

7949
04:08:04,399 --> 04:08:05,600
emails to keep nurturing them.

7950
04:08:05,600 --> 04:08:06,560
Basically, whenever we need more

7951
04:08:06,560 --> 04:08:07,840
clients, the reason we've always been

7952
04:08:07,840 --> 04:08:10,000
booked out is cuz we'll either go back

7953
04:08:10,000 --> 04:08:11,199
to the people who are on the waiting

7954
04:08:11,199 --> 04:08:13,680
list or we'll shoot out an email to our

7955
04:08:13,680 --> 04:08:15,680
uh the people who we turn away cuz we're

7956
04:08:15,680 --> 04:08:17,680
too busy and shoot them an email and

7957
04:08:17,680 --> 04:08:20,000
boom, we're instantly booked up. So,

7958
04:08:20,000 --> 04:08:22,479
this is incredibly powerful if you do it

7959
04:08:22,479 --> 04:08:25,840
right. And this step, if you can really

7960
04:08:25,840 --> 04:08:27,520
understand it, is the key because you're

7961
04:08:27,520 --> 04:08:29,560
going to be able to get a more

7962
04:08:29,560 --> 04:08:32,239
cons out of the content you you create

7963
04:08:32,239 --> 04:08:33,840
more and you consistently build this

7964
04:08:33,840 --> 04:08:35,199
list so that whenever you need more

7965
04:08:35,199 --> 04:08:37,199
clients, shoot that offer out directly

7966
04:08:37,199 --> 04:08:38,399
and most of the other time you're just

7967
04:08:38,399 --> 04:08:39,680
sharing value as well. So, what I'm

7968
04:08:39,680 --> 04:08:41,600
going to do as a an example to show you

7969
04:08:41,600 --> 04:08:43,279
that this stuff works is that I put

7970
04:08:43,279 --> 04:08:45,199
together a resource, giving you a

7971
04:08:45,199 --> 04:08:46,880
breakdown on the exact strategies I do

7972
04:08:46,880 --> 04:08:49,040
to the initial version of a content

7973
04:08:49,040 --> 04:08:50,640
funnel like this. A step-by-step

7974
04:08:50,640 --> 04:08:52,000
worksheet for you to go step by step

7975
04:08:52,000 --> 04:08:54,160
through and to achieve something based.

7976
04:08:54,160 --> 04:08:55,840
I get it. It may seem overwhelming for

7977
04:08:55,840 --> 04:08:57,439
you, but if you want consistent leads,

7978
04:08:57,439 --> 04:08:58,800
you need to start doing this now. And

7979
04:08:58,800 --> 04:09:00,399
also, the personal branding aspect can

7980
04:09:00,399 --> 04:09:03,840
completely change your life. Like, it is

7981
04:09:03,840 --> 04:09:05,920
absolutely changed my life. And the

7982
04:09:05,920 --> 04:09:07,199
reason I keep making these videos and

7983
04:09:07,199 --> 04:09:08,640
trying to help so many of you is because

7984
04:09:08,640 --> 04:09:11,199
the bigger my personal brand gets, the

7985
04:09:11,199 --> 04:09:12,800
bigger like the leads we're getting

7986
04:09:12,800 --> 04:09:14,399
through the doors at Morningside are

7987
04:09:14,399 --> 04:09:15,680
ridiculous. Off some of these these

7988
04:09:15,680 --> 04:09:17,520
bigger like AI agents videos that are

7989
04:09:17,520 --> 04:09:19,439
posted, the amount of people who see my

7990
04:09:19,439 --> 04:09:21,279
face and hear my story and hear that I

7991
04:09:21,279 --> 04:09:24,680
have a development company and it's

7992
04:09:24,680 --> 04:09:26,880
ridiculous if you can do it right.

7993
04:09:26,880 --> 04:09:29,199
Right. So the bigger my personal brand

7994
04:09:29,199 --> 04:09:30,399
gets, the bigger opportunities I get

7995
04:09:30,399 --> 04:09:32,080
thrown at me full stop. And if you guys

7996
04:09:32,080 --> 04:09:33,520
can just get the ball rolling with this,

7997
04:09:33,520 --> 04:09:35,279
then you get a flywheel. you can just

7998
04:09:35,279 --> 04:09:37,040
okay I'm making money now let's now

7999
04:09:37,040 --> 04:09:38,560
let's re-engineer the content let's

8000
04:09:38,560 --> 04:09:39,920
think bigger let's let's up the

8001
04:09:39,920 --> 04:09:41,760
production let's let's get a bigger team

8002
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:43,840
on then you get in this flywheel and I

8003
04:09:43,840 --> 04:09:46,080
promise you if you can get a significant

8004
04:09:46,080 --> 04:09:47,279
personal brand in the AI space through

8005
04:09:47,279 --> 04:09:48,640
your content creation even if it's just

8006
04:09:48,640 --> 04:09:51,120
within your niche you will have so many

8007
04:09:51,120 --> 04:09:53,840
opportunities th you want AI right now

8008
04:09:53,840 --> 04:09:55,680
everyone wants you're like a a mini

8009
04:09:55,680 --> 04:09:57,359
celebrity amongst the right people

8010
04:09:57,359 --> 04:09:59,279
because they're just clueless when it

8011
04:09:59,279 --> 04:10:01,239
comes to AI and they want to be in on it

8012
04:10:01,239 --> 04:10:03,279
so I'm going to be giving you guys a

8013
04:10:03,279 --> 04:10:05,120
step-by-step breakdown of how to put

8014
04:10:05,120 --> 04:10:06,640
together this for yourself. And I know

8015
04:10:06,640 --> 04:10:07,920
that for those of you who put this into

8016
04:10:07,920 --> 04:10:10,560
action this year, by like bang on middle

8017
04:10:10,560 --> 04:10:12,640
of this year, you're going to have no

8018
04:10:12,640 --> 04:10:13,920
more issues. You're never going to be

8019
04:10:13,920 --> 04:10:15,680
worrying about getting a client again

8020
04:10:15,680 --> 04:10:17,120
cuz you'll have a few thousand people on

8021
04:10:17,120 --> 04:10:19,760
your email list. You'll have 10 20,000

8022
04:10:19,760 --> 04:10:21,760
followers on your chosen platform and

8023
04:10:21,760 --> 04:10:23,840
you will just be printing. All right, so

8024
04:10:23,840 --> 04:10:24,840
that's

8025
04:10:24,840 --> 04:10:27,680
been marketing 101, digital marketing

8026
04:10:27,680 --> 04:10:30,399
101, organic organic content funnels.

8027
04:10:30,399 --> 04:10:32,800
Um, rewatch this if you need to go make

8028
04:10:32,800 --> 04:10:34,800
notes. Again, understanding cold, warm,

8029
04:10:34,800 --> 04:10:37,279
hot, rented, and owned audiences,

8030
04:10:37,279 --> 04:10:39,600
nurturing these key these key things,

8031
04:10:39,600 --> 04:10:42,800
call to actions, awareness. Actually, I

8032
04:10:42,800 --> 04:10:44,000
should have done more of these problems,

8033
04:10:44,000 --> 04:10:45,439
but you get the idea. Problem one,

8034
04:10:45,439 --> 04:10:47,120
awareness. Problem two, getting them

8035
04:10:47,120 --> 04:10:48,560
into your owned audience. Problem three,

8036
04:10:48,560 --> 04:10:50,720
getting them into book and conversion.

8037
04:10:50,720 --> 04:10:53,040
So, it's been a bit of a freestyle one

8038
04:10:53,040 --> 04:10:56,160
for you guys. Um,

8039
04:10:56,359 --> 04:10:58,399
again, appreciate you all for the

8040
04:10:58,399 --> 04:11:00,000
support recently. It's been incredible.

8041
04:11:00,000 --> 04:11:02,160
Um, I I'm so fortunate to be in this

8042
04:11:02,160 --> 04:11:04,319
position where I get to make a video and

8043
04:11:04,319 --> 04:11:06,399
and help tens of thousands or hundreds

8044
04:11:06,399 --> 04:11:09,120
of millions of people. Um, and yeah, I

8045
04:11:09,120 --> 04:11:10,479
just hope you guys know that I'm I'm

8046
04:11:10,479 --> 04:11:11,439
going to really keep pushing it this

8047
04:11:11,439 --> 04:11:13,680
year. Me and my team are going all in on

8048
04:11:13,680 --> 04:11:14,880
helping as many of you as possible

8049
04:11:14,880 --> 04:11:16,560
because while there's massive benefits

8050
04:11:16,560 --> 04:11:17,920
for you, there's also massive benefits

8051
04:11:17,920 --> 04:11:20,399
for me and I, like I said, we get so

8052
04:11:20,399 --> 04:11:21,760
many massive opportunities to meet

8053
04:11:21,760 --> 04:11:23,840
because of how fast this brand is going.

8054
04:11:23,840 --> 04:11:25,279
So, I just really appreciate all your

8055
04:11:25,279 --> 04:11:26,960
support and I hope you know that me and

8056
04:11:26,960 --> 04:11:28,319
my team are doing everything we can to

8057
04:11:28,319 --> 04:11:30,000
keep helping you. and we've got a lot of

8058
04:11:30,000 --> 04:11:31,439
cool stuff in the works for this year.

8059
04:11:31,439 --> 04:11:35,760
So, um, yeah, that's all with the

8060
04:11:36,520 --> 04:11:38,720
video. In this video, we'll be covering

8061
04:11:38,720 --> 04:11:40,640
the fundamentals of pricing your AI

8062
04:11:40,640 --> 04:11:42,239
products and services, the common

8063
04:11:42,239 --> 04:11:44,479
mistakes beginners make, and the exact

8064
04:11:44,479 --> 04:11:46,160
steps to go from offering free projects

8065
04:11:46,160 --> 04:11:47,920
initially to landing profitable deals

8066
04:11:47,920 --> 04:11:49,120
down the line. So, we're going to be

8067
04:11:49,120 --> 04:11:50,239
ripping through the slideshow here,

8068
04:11:50,239 --> 04:11:51,520
which is going to be available as a free

8069
04:11:51,520 --> 04:11:52,880
resource on my school community if you

8070
04:11:52,880 --> 04:11:54,080
want to jump on there and grab it. So,

8071
04:11:54,080 --> 04:11:55,120
let's get started. So, what are we going

8072
04:11:55,120 --> 04:11:56,239
to be covering today? These are the

8073
04:11:56,239 --> 04:11:57,600
topics. I'm just going to jump straight

8074
04:11:57,600 --> 04:11:59,600
into them now. So firstly, why pricing

8075
04:11:59,600 --> 04:12:01,520
matters? Why is it so important? Well,

8076
04:12:01,520 --> 04:12:02,960
it's actually the foundation of your

8077
04:12:02,960 --> 04:12:04,880
agency because we are running a business

8078
04:12:04,880 --> 04:12:06,720
and you need to charge a certain amount

8079
04:12:06,720 --> 04:12:08,479
in order to make a profit. Your price

8080
04:12:08,479 --> 04:12:09,840
and the price that you charge out at

8081
04:12:09,840 --> 04:12:11,120
needs to be more than the cost that you

8082
04:12:11,120 --> 04:12:12,720
incur to deliver that service. That's

8083
04:12:12,720 --> 04:12:14,399
how we make profit and that's how a

8084
04:12:14,399 --> 04:12:15,600
business works. If you don't make

8085
04:12:15,600 --> 04:12:17,279
profit, you don't really have a business

8086
04:12:17,279 --> 04:12:18,880
or some big tech companies would say

8087
04:12:18,880 --> 04:12:20,479
otherwise. But for businesses that we

8088
04:12:20,479 --> 04:12:21,680
want to run, you need to make profit.

8089
04:12:21,680 --> 04:12:23,040
And at a basic level, the pricing

8090
04:12:23,040 --> 04:12:24,560
strategy you use determines how much

8091
04:12:24,560 --> 04:12:25,840
profit you can make. Secondly, our

8092
04:12:25,840 --> 04:12:27,520
pricing shows our value. So the amount

8093
04:12:27,520 --> 04:12:29,199
that we're charging out tells clients

8094
04:12:29,199 --> 04:12:30,560
how good our services are. Basically,

8095
04:12:30,560 --> 04:12:32,160
the more we're charging, clients and

8096
04:12:32,160 --> 04:12:34,720
people in general see price or or high

8097
04:12:34,720 --> 04:12:36,560
prices as a proxy for value. So we

8098
04:12:36,560 --> 04:12:37,920
assume that more expensive things are

8099
04:12:37,920 --> 04:12:39,600
more valuable inherently. Thirdly, it

8100
04:12:39,600 --> 04:12:40,960
shapes your work and your life as an

8101
04:12:40,960 --> 04:12:42,479
agency owner. For example, your pricing

8102
04:12:42,479 --> 04:12:43,680
strategy determines if you're going to

8103
04:12:43,680 --> 04:12:45,600
be taking on one big project every few

8104
04:12:45,600 --> 04:12:47,040
months or lots of little ones in order

8105
04:12:47,040 --> 04:12:48,319
to get that revenue number that you're

8106
04:12:48,319 --> 04:12:50,000
chasing. And also, we have things like

8107
04:12:50,000 --> 04:12:51,279
retainer. So it really shapes the way

8108
04:12:51,279 --> 04:12:52,479
that your business operates on a

8109
04:12:52,479 --> 04:12:54,239
day-to-day. And finally, an effective

8110
04:12:54,239 --> 04:12:55,680
pricing strategy is what is going to

8111
04:12:55,680 --> 04:12:57,199
actually grow your business over time.

8112
04:12:57,199 --> 04:12:58,960
Making sure you have enough profit so

8113
04:12:58,960 --> 04:13:00,319
that you can reinvest into the key parts

8114
04:13:00,319 --> 04:13:01,920
of the business that need it, marketing,

8115
04:13:01,920 --> 04:13:03,760
product, team, etc. So the main thing

8116
04:13:03,760 --> 04:13:04,800
you need to understand when you're

8117
04:13:04,800 --> 04:13:06,479
pricing your AI services and solutions

8118
04:13:06,479 --> 04:13:08,399
is what I call the value formula. So

8119
04:13:08,399 --> 04:13:10,239
this is a combination of your skills and

8120
04:13:10,239 --> 04:13:11,600
your experience. And those two added

8121
04:13:11,600 --> 04:13:13,040
together is what determines your value

8122
04:13:13,040 --> 04:13:14,319
and therefore how much you can charge

8123
04:13:14,319 --> 04:13:15,680
for your solutions. So this is the frame

8124
04:13:15,680 --> 04:13:17,359
that I want you to to look through. It's

8125
04:13:17,359 --> 04:13:19,040
like okay, what skills do I have and

8126
04:13:19,040 --> 04:13:20,960
what experience do I have? Skills are

8127
04:13:20,960 --> 04:13:22,319
your technical abilities like building

8128
04:13:22,319 --> 04:13:24,479
chat bots on voice flow, automating

8129
04:13:24,479 --> 04:13:26,239
processes with make.com, etc. All the

8130
04:13:26,239 --> 04:13:27,920
other stuff I teach on this channel and

8131
04:13:27,920 --> 04:13:29,359
then your experience is the actual

8132
04:13:29,359 --> 04:13:30,880
practical wisdom gained from real

8133
04:13:30,880 --> 04:13:32,399
projects and delivering that in the real

8134
04:13:32,399 --> 04:13:33,920
world by actually taking your skills and

8135
04:13:33,920 --> 04:13:35,520
applying them in the real world to build

8136
04:13:35,520 --> 04:13:37,040
AI solutions for businesses all for

8137
04:13:37,040 --> 04:13:38,479
yourself. You gain a much deeper and

8138
04:13:38,479 --> 04:13:40,000
richer understanding of what it actually

8139
04:13:40,000 --> 04:13:41,760
takes to make a successful AI

8140
04:13:41,760 --> 04:13:43,760
implementation in the real world. And so

8141
04:13:43,760 --> 04:13:45,040
the experience that you gain through

8142
04:13:45,040 --> 04:13:46,720
delivering multiple projects ideally in

8143
04:13:46,720 --> 04:13:48,479
the same niche or within a a similar

8144
04:13:48,479 --> 04:13:50,880
similar area. Um the experience you gain

8145
04:13:50,880 --> 04:13:52,720
increases your value to the client by

8146
04:13:52,720 --> 04:13:54,319
reducing the project risk because you've

8147
04:13:54,319 --> 04:13:55,439
been through it before and you see the

8148
04:13:55,439 --> 04:13:57,199
pitfalls and and the potholes along the

8149
04:13:57,199 --> 04:13:58,640
way. Um you can speed up the

8150
04:13:58,640 --> 04:14:00,000
implementation because you can sort of

8151
04:14:00,000 --> 04:14:01,120
go straight through and you don't need

8152
04:14:01,120 --> 04:14:03,199
to hit all those potholes along the way.

8153
04:14:03,199 --> 04:14:04,640
And finally, you can better align the

8154
04:14:04,640 --> 04:14:06,000
solutions with the business needs from

8155
04:14:06,000 --> 04:14:07,920
your experience. So the more experience

8156
04:14:07,920 --> 04:14:09,600
you gain, that's the way that you can

8157
04:14:09,600 --> 04:14:10,720
increase your value. And of course, the

8158
04:14:10,720 --> 04:14:12,319
more skills you have, either yourself or

8159
04:14:12,319 --> 04:14:14,000
within your organization by hiring other

8160
04:14:14,000 --> 04:14:15,520
people. So the skills and the experience

8161
04:14:15,520 --> 04:14:16,880
is what goes together to determine your

8162
04:14:16,880 --> 04:14:17,920
value. And so now that you understand

8163
04:14:17,920 --> 04:14:19,199
this value formula, just hold that

8164
04:14:19,199 --> 04:14:20,399
thought cuz we'll be back to it in a

8165
04:14:20,399 --> 04:14:22,080
second. Then we get into pricing basics.

8166
04:14:22,080 --> 04:14:24,080
So we have products and services. And

8167
04:14:24,080 --> 04:14:25,760
services are typically charged by time.

8168
04:14:25,760 --> 04:14:27,359
So you go to a legal professional and

8169
04:14:27,359 --> 04:14:29,199
you charge or you ask for, hey, I need

8170
04:14:29,199 --> 04:14:30,319
these legal services. They're going to

8171
04:14:30,319 --> 04:14:32,239
bill you by time. Like how many hours is

8172
04:14:32,239 --> 04:14:33,439
it going to take for me to do the thing

8173
04:14:33,439 --> 04:14:35,279
you need to do? Whereas with products,

8174
04:14:35,279 --> 04:14:37,439
it's done by perceived or real value. So

8175
04:14:37,439 --> 04:14:40,000
if you sell me a an iPhone or something,

8176
04:14:40,000 --> 04:14:40,960
I'm not going to be looking at the

8177
04:14:40,960 --> 04:14:42,399
number of hours it took you to build it.

8178
04:14:42,399 --> 04:14:44,000
There's a perceived value of that iPhone

8179
04:14:44,000 --> 04:14:45,840
of value that I can get out of it. And

8180
04:14:45,840 --> 04:14:47,279
that's what I'm willing to pay for. So

8181
04:14:47,279 --> 04:14:48,960
products and services priced very

8182
04:14:48,960 --> 04:14:50,000
differently. And this is important

8183
04:14:50,000 --> 04:14:51,279
because if you're selling a product and

8184
04:14:51,279 --> 04:14:53,279
you want to show value, you need to

8185
04:14:53,279 --> 04:14:55,840
provide some data on how that value was

8186
04:14:55,840 --> 04:14:57,760
created in a business setting at least.

8187
04:14:57,760 --> 04:14:59,760
So, if I'm selling a AI solution to a

8188
04:14:59,760 --> 04:15:01,439
business, they want to see, okay, well,

8189
04:15:01,439 --> 04:15:02,880
if you're putting this website chatbot

8190
04:15:02,880 --> 04:15:05,040
on my my landing page, how many people

8191
04:15:05,040 --> 04:15:06,239
are going to engage with it? How many

8192
04:15:06,239 --> 04:15:07,840
people are going to provide their lead

8193
04:15:07,840 --> 04:15:09,680
information? How many people have based

8194
04:15:09,680 --> 04:15:10,880
on my close rate, is that going to

8195
04:15:10,880 --> 04:15:12,399
convert into into closed deals? And how

8196
04:15:12,399 --> 04:15:13,680
much revenue am I going to get? So, what

8197
04:15:13,680 --> 04:15:15,920
is the the data that shows that there is

8198
04:15:15,920 --> 04:15:17,120
some value attached to this? Because if

8199
04:15:17,120 --> 04:15:18,560
there's no data showing that someone's

8200
04:15:18,560 --> 04:15:19,760
going to use it, then you're kind of

8201
04:15:19,760 --> 04:15:21,040
just taking a stab in the dark and

8202
04:15:21,040 --> 04:15:22,720
making up numbers about the value that

8203
04:15:22,720 --> 04:15:24,239
this product or that this thing will be

8204
04:15:24,239 --> 04:15:25,520
able to create for the business owner.

8205
04:15:25,520 --> 04:15:27,279
So in order to prove or communicate

8206
04:15:27,279 --> 04:15:29,600
value, you need data in most cases. But

8207
04:15:29,600 --> 04:15:30,800
beginners when you're starting an AI

8208
04:15:30,800 --> 04:15:32,640
automation agency, you don't have any

8209
04:15:32,640 --> 04:15:34,880
firsthand data or proof of results.

8210
04:15:34,880 --> 04:15:36,560
Therefore, starting out with the AI

8211
04:15:36,560 --> 04:15:38,239
development services rather than trying

8212
04:15:38,239 --> 04:15:40,239
to go for products immediately is best.

8213
04:15:40,239 --> 04:15:42,319
So services, you can charge it based on

8214
04:15:42,319 --> 04:15:44,159
your time or the time of your developer.

8215
04:15:44,159 --> 04:15:45,439
So you can start off with no code and

8216
04:15:45,439 --> 04:15:47,520
low code tools and operate as an agency

8217
04:15:47,520 --> 04:15:48,800
where you offer your services.

8218
04:15:48,800 --> 04:15:50,399
Basically, we can build this thing. and

8219
04:15:50,399 --> 04:15:52,159
we're going to calculate how much time

8220
04:15:52,159 --> 04:15:53,439
it's going to take for us and then we're

8221
04:15:53,439 --> 04:15:54,800
going to give you a proposal or a quote

8222
04:15:54,800 --> 04:15:56,720
based on those hours rather than this

8223
04:15:56,720 --> 04:15:58,800
product and value based on which you can

8224
04:15:58,800 --> 04:16:00,319
we'll talk about later. So getting onto

8225
04:16:00,319 --> 04:16:01,760
your first project as a beginner with an

8226
04:16:01,760 --> 04:16:03,920
AI automation agency you'll either be

8227
04:16:03,920 --> 04:16:05,040
self-d delivering or you'll be

8228
04:16:05,040 --> 04:16:06,800
delegating it to a developer. So I

8229
04:16:06,800 --> 04:16:08,399
recommend that you start out by

8230
04:16:08,399 --> 04:16:10,239
delivering them yourself if possible. It

8231
04:16:10,239 --> 04:16:11,359
gives you a chance to actually build

8232
04:16:11,359 --> 04:16:13,199
that experience for yourself rather than

8233
04:16:13,199 --> 04:16:15,199
relying entirely on other people. it is

8234
04:16:15,199 --> 04:16:17,279
not not a great fit for some people. But

8235
04:16:17,279 --> 04:16:18,720
ideally, you start off with some

8236
04:16:18,720 --> 04:16:20,479
straightforward projects by posting say

8237
04:16:20,479 --> 04:16:22,239
in my school community. Easy way to get

8238
04:16:22,239 --> 04:16:23,359
your first client is just going to my

8239
04:16:23,359 --> 04:16:24,720
school community and post, hey, I know

8240
04:16:24,720 --> 04:16:26,319
how to do this or this is what I've been

8241
04:16:26,319 --> 04:16:27,920
building recently. Anyone interested in

8242
04:16:27,920 --> 04:16:29,359
something similar? You'll be shocked how

8243
04:16:29,359 --> 04:16:30,960
much attention you get and how easy it

8244
04:16:30,960 --> 04:16:32,159
is to get your first client there. I've

8245
04:16:32,159 --> 04:16:33,279
heard of so many stories like that in

8246
04:16:33,279 --> 04:16:34,640
the free community. Anyway, so you want

8247
04:16:34,640 --> 04:16:35,600
to be getting started with these

8248
04:16:35,600 --> 04:16:36,720
straightforward projects that you can

8249
04:16:36,720 --> 04:16:38,479
deliver yourself using no code and low

8250
04:16:38,479 --> 04:16:40,399
code tools ideally so you don't have any

8251
04:16:40,399 --> 04:16:41,680
cost associated because if you're

8252
04:16:41,680 --> 04:16:43,120
delivering yourself, you can go to

8253
04:16:43,120 --> 04:16:44,399
someone and say, "Hey, I'll work for you

8254
04:16:44,399 --> 04:16:45,840
for free so that I can build my

8255
04:16:45,840 --> 04:16:46,800
experience and then become more

8256
04:16:46,800 --> 04:16:48,080
valuable." And this ties back into the

8257
04:16:48,080 --> 04:16:49,600
value formula that we mentioned earlier

8258
04:16:49,600 --> 04:16:51,680
where initially you have some skills.

8259
04:16:51,680 --> 04:16:52,880
Yes, you might spend a month or two

8260
04:16:52,880 --> 04:16:54,640
learning uh different AI automation

8261
04:16:54,640 --> 04:16:56,319
tools, but you have no experience. So

8262
04:16:56,319 --> 04:16:57,840
that limits your value. Therefore, you

8263
04:16:57,840 --> 04:16:58,880
should be going in to find these

8264
04:16:58,880 --> 04:17:00,080
straightforward projects where you can

8265
04:17:00,080 --> 04:17:01,840
offer your services for free in exchange

8266
04:17:01,840 --> 04:17:03,439
for getting experience, which in the

8267
04:17:03,439 --> 04:17:04,560
long run will make you much more

8268
04:17:04,560 --> 04:17:06,080
valuable. So, starting off with some

8269
04:17:06,080 --> 04:17:07,439
straightforward projects you can deliver

8270
04:17:07,439 --> 04:17:09,040
yourself using no code and low code

8271
04:17:09,040 --> 04:17:10,880
tools is ideal so that you don't have

8272
04:17:10,880 --> 04:17:12,319
any cost. And because you don't have any

8273
04:17:12,319 --> 04:17:13,520
cost, you're not needing to take money

8274
04:17:13,520 --> 04:17:15,040
from the client to stay at least at

8275
04:17:15,040 --> 04:17:16,880
break even. So, do your first few

8276
04:17:16,880 --> 04:17:18,960
projects for free if possible if you are

8277
04:17:18,960 --> 04:17:20,399
self-d delivering to build your

8278
04:17:20,399 --> 04:17:21,840
experience in order to become more

8279
04:17:21,840 --> 04:17:24,560
valuable. However, if you must hire and

8280
04:17:24,560 --> 04:17:25,439
you're one of those people who just

8281
04:17:25,439 --> 04:17:27,199
refuses to do a bit of tinkering

8282
04:17:27,199 --> 04:17:28,560
themselves and get a bit of hands-on

8283
04:17:28,560 --> 04:17:30,080
experience, then you should be offering

8284
04:17:30,080 --> 04:17:31,920
your services at cost in my experience

8285
04:17:31,920 --> 04:17:33,359
and in my opinion because since you

8286
04:17:33,359 --> 04:17:34,640
don't have any experience delivering

8287
04:17:34,640 --> 04:17:36,239
these kind of projects, it's a bit

8288
04:17:36,239 --> 04:17:37,279
richer for you to go to these clients

8289
04:17:37,279 --> 04:17:38,720
and say, "Hey, look, I want you to pay

8290
04:17:38,720 --> 04:17:40,479
me to learn on your business, which is

8291
04:17:40,479 --> 04:17:41,520
basically what you're saying. So, it

8292
04:17:41,520 --> 04:17:42,960
does depend on your situation. If you

8293
04:17:42,960 --> 04:17:44,560
bring on a developer who has a ton of

8294
04:17:44,560 --> 04:17:46,159
experience, then technically the

8295
04:17:46,159 --> 04:17:47,680
experience for your entire organization

8296
04:17:47,680 --> 04:17:49,439
goes up and the skills also and

8297
04:17:49,439 --> 04:17:50,640
therefore you become a little bit more

8298
04:17:50,640 --> 04:17:52,239
valuable. But as a rule of thumb when

8299
04:17:52,239 --> 04:17:53,439
you are getting started, even if you're

8300
04:17:53,439 --> 04:17:55,359
delegating and hiring a developer, then

8301
04:17:55,359 --> 04:17:56,800
I recommend that you offer your services

8302
04:17:56,800 --> 04:17:58,399
at cost just to take the pressure off

8303
04:17:58,399 --> 04:17:59,840
your back as well. Communicate that

8304
04:17:59,840 --> 04:18:01,600
clearly with your first client or a

8305
04:18:01,600 --> 04:18:02,880
couple of clients. Say, "Hey, look,

8306
04:18:02,880 --> 04:18:04,080
here's what we've built in the past or

8307
04:18:04,080 --> 04:18:05,439
here's what we've built for ourselves."

8308
04:18:05,439 --> 04:18:06,880
Just any kind of proof you can get to

8309
04:18:06,880 --> 04:18:07,920
show that you know what you're talking

8310
04:18:07,920 --> 04:18:09,359
about and that there's a reasonable

8311
04:18:09,359 --> 04:18:10,960
likelihood of you actually seeing this

8312
04:18:10,960 --> 04:18:12,399
thing for you as a beginner. But coming

8313
04:18:12,399 --> 04:18:13,680
in and offering your services at cost

8314
04:18:13,680 --> 04:18:14,800
and being like, "Hey, I have my

8315
04:18:14,800 --> 04:18:15,920
developer. I'm willing to do this deal

8316
04:18:15,920 --> 04:18:17,439
for you at cost because I value your

8317
04:18:17,439 --> 04:18:18,720
testimonial more than the money that

8318
04:18:18,720 --> 04:18:20,080
this will make me." And a really key

8319
04:18:20,080 --> 04:18:21,520
point here at the end, which is by

8320
04:18:21,520 --> 04:18:23,439
offering them projects at cost, clients

8321
04:18:23,439 --> 04:18:25,040
will be more lenient with you if things

8322
04:18:25,040 --> 04:18:26,479
fall short of your expectations, which

8323
04:18:26,479 --> 04:18:28,239
as a beginner, delivering your first few

8324
04:18:28,239 --> 04:18:30,080
projects is highly likely because you

8325
04:18:30,080 --> 04:18:32,000
have you you sell them the dream just to

8326
04:18:32,000 --> 04:18:33,920
get the the deal over the line. And

8327
04:18:33,920 --> 04:18:35,199
unfortunately, you realize it's a lot

8328
04:18:35,199 --> 04:18:36,960
more difficult to deliver that than uh

8329
04:18:36,960 --> 04:18:38,560
than you expected. So, it's completely

8330
04:18:38,560 --> 04:18:40,560
normal, but the issue is exacerbated if

8331
04:18:40,560 --> 04:18:41,520
you've charged them a whole bunch of

8332
04:18:41,520 --> 04:18:42,479
money and you were going to be trying to

8333
04:18:42,479 --> 04:18:44,080
pocket a few, thousand starting out. And

8334
04:18:44,080 --> 04:18:45,359
this kind of thing of rushing to the

8335
04:18:45,359 --> 04:18:46,880
money and trying to skip this learning

8336
04:18:46,880 --> 04:18:48,720
phase and going straight to selling and

8337
04:18:48,720 --> 04:18:50,080
making as much money you can out of this

8338
04:18:50,080 --> 04:18:52,000
AI space is really one of the biggest

8339
04:18:52,000 --> 04:18:53,279
issues that I'm seeing in beginners

8340
04:18:53,279 --> 04:18:54,720
approaching this. I was on my free

8341
04:18:54,720 --> 04:18:56,239
community Q&A in the school school

8342
04:18:56,239 --> 04:18:57,279
community this morning and there was

8343
04:18:57,279 --> 04:18:58,640
this guy who came up on stage and he was

8344
04:18:58,640 --> 04:18:59,840
saying I'm going to be selling gyms this

8345
04:18:59,840 --> 04:19:01,520
this and this. I was like well have you

8346
04:19:01,520 --> 04:19:02,800
what have you done? What are your baby

8347
04:19:02,800 --> 04:19:04,000
steps that you've done to get to this

8348
04:19:04,000 --> 04:19:05,760
point of selling this big expensive

8349
04:19:05,760 --> 04:19:07,359
package to them? It's like oh well like

8350
04:19:07,359 --> 04:19:08,880
no I've just I've just started like how

8351
04:19:08,880 --> 04:19:11,040
how hard can it be? But if you're a

8352
04:19:11,040 --> 04:19:13,920
beginner, just take baby steps and focus

8353
04:19:13,920 --> 04:19:15,439
on learning before earning because if

8354
04:19:15,439 --> 04:19:17,199
you try to jump to the earning part,

8355
04:19:17,199 --> 04:19:18,159
you're just going to get chewed up and

8356
04:19:18,159 --> 04:19:19,840
sped out by this AI space. And I I

8357
04:19:19,840 --> 04:19:21,279
promise you that. So taking it slow and

8358
04:19:21,279 --> 04:19:22,640
zooming out and seeing this is a long

8359
04:19:22,640 --> 04:19:23,840
process where you need to build your

8360
04:19:23,840 --> 04:19:25,840
skills and expertise by doing regular

8361
04:19:25,840 --> 04:19:27,439
deliveries, even if that means taking

8362
04:19:27,439 --> 04:19:29,040
less money up front so that you can make

8363
04:19:29,040 --> 04:19:30,640
more money later on. So it's about

8364
04:19:30,640 --> 04:19:32,640
staying in the game, not maxing things

8365
04:19:32,640 --> 04:19:33,920
out immediately as soon as you get in

8366
04:19:33,920 --> 04:19:35,920
here. So after delivering a few free or

8367
04:19:35,920 --> 04:19:37,600
lowcost projects just to get up your

8368
04:19:37,600 --> 04:19:39,199
experience, you're now becoming valuable

8369
04:19:39,199 --> 04:19:40,560
enough that you can start to charge for

8370
04:19:40,560 --> 04:19:41,920
your services. And when you get to this

8371
04:19:41,920 --> 04:19:43,120
point, the pricing structure and

8372
04:19:43,120 --> 04:19:44,319
strategy that I recommend for all

8373
04:19:44,319 --> 04:19:45,840
beginners is what's called cost plus

8374
04:19:45,840 --> 04:19:47,439
pricing. This is what I started off with

8375
04:19:47,439 --> 04:19:49,040
my own agency, Morningington.AI when we

8376
04:19:49,040 --> 04:19:50,640
were first getting started back in early

8377
04:19:50,640 --> 04:19:52,960
2023. So after you deliver a few free or

8378
04:19:52,960 --> 04:19:54,319
cost projects, your experience has

8379
04:19:54,319 --> 04:19:55,439
increased. Therefore, you are more

8380
04:19:55,439 --> 04:19:57,199
valuable. If you haven't already hired a

8381
04:19:57,199 --> 04:19:58,800
developer, now is a good time to do so.

8382
04:19:58,800 --> 04:20:00,399
And so from now on, you should be adding

8383
04:20:00,399 --> 04:20:01,840
some profit to your deals with what's

8384
04:20:01,840 --> 04:20:03,840
known as cost plus pricing. In order to

8385
04:20:03,840 --> 04:20:05,439
do cost plus pricing, you need to

8386
04:20:05,439 --> 04:20:07,199
estimate the time and resources required

8387
04:20:07,199 --> 04:20:08,720
to deliver a client's project. So they

8388
04:20:08,720 --> 04:20:10,399
come to you or you reach out to them and

8389
04:20:10,399 --> 04:20:11,600
offer a service. And then once you've

8390
04:20:11,600 --> 04:20:12,960
fully scoped the project and determine

8391
04:20:12,960 --> 04:20:14,000
what they need and what you're going to

8392
04:20:14,000 --> 04:20:15,920
need to build, you can do an estimate of

8393
04:20:15,920 --> 04:20:17,680
the time and resources required and how

8394
04:20:17,680 --> 04:20:18,880
much that's going to cost you. And then

8395
04:20:18,880 --> 04:20:20,319
you need to get your developers hourly

8396
04:20:20,319 --> 04:20:21,520
rate that you've hired on to take these

8397
04:20:21,520 --> 04:20:23,439
projects. And that may be from $30 to

8398
04:20:23,439 --> 04:20:24,880
$50 an hour depending on how skilled

8399
04:20:24,880 --> 04:20:26,080
they are and how experienced. And then

8400
04:20:26,080 --> 04:20:27,520
you can apply markup to get your final

8401
04:20:27,520 --> 04:20:28,880
cost. So, for example, if the project

8402
04:20:28,880 --> 04:20:30,640
was estimated to take 60 hours of dev

8403
04:20:30,640 --> 04:20:32,319
work with your one dev and he or she

8404
04:20:32,319 --> 04:20:34,239
costs $50 an hour, then when we multiply

8405
04:20:34,239 --> 04:20:35,760
these two together and then add our

8406
04:20:35,760 --> 04:20:38,159
markup of say 2x or 3x, I recommend that

8407
04:20:38,159 --> 04:20:39,439
you start off with 2x. It's what we did

8408
04:20:39,439 --> 04:20:40,880
at my agency. So, you just basically get

8409
04:20:40,880 --> 04:20:42,560
the developer cost and double it. That's

8410
04:20:42,560 --> 04:20:43,840
a good starting point for starting to

8411
04:20:43,840 --> 04:20:45,120
actually make profit on your on your

8412
04:20:45,120 --> 04:20:46,479
deals. And then you can start to

8413
04:20:46,479 --> 04:20:48,399
increase that to 3, four, 5x. We

8414
04:20:48,399 --> 04:20:50,239
eventually got up to six or 7x for some

8415
04:20:50,239 --> 04:20:52,000
of the larger projects we did. Um, you

8416
04:20:52,000 --> 04:20:53,199
can just continue to increase that and

8417
04:20:53,199 --> 04:20:54,399
that's going to give you a nice healthy

8418
04:20:54,399 --> 04:20:55,920
margin. you've got the experience needed

8419
04:20:55,920 --> 04:20:57,760
to justify you charging these prices.

8420
04:20:57,760 --> 04:20:59,199
When it comes to signing the deal and

8421
04:20:59,199 --> 04:21:00,960
getting the first uh invoice paid and

8422
04:21:00,960 --> 04:21:02,239
getting the money in your account,

8423
04:21:02,239 --> 04:21:03,279
there's a few different ways that you

8424
04:21:03,279 --> 04:21:04,880
can structure the payment terms. The one

8425
04:21:04,880 --> 04:21:06,080
that I started out with and the one I

8426
04:21:06,080 --> 04:21:07,600
recommend to most beginners, um

8427
04:21:07,600 --> 04:21:08,880
particularly on projects that are kind

8428
04:21:08,880 --> 04:21:12,000
of under 20 to $30,000 is a 50% upfront

8429
04:21:12,000 --> 04:21:14,319
and 50% on completion structure. Um,

8430
04:21:14,319 --> 04:21:15,439
this structure is really good when

8431
04:21:15,439 --> 04:21:16,640
you're starting out because if you're

8432
04:21:16,640 --> 04:21:18,319
just doing a 2x markup, like I said,

8433
04:21:18,319 --> 04:21:20,239
like you've got $1,000 of cost and then

8434
04:21:20,239 --> 04:21:22,720
$2,000 um price that you're charging up.

8435
04:21:22,720 --> 04:21:24,560
Um, when you take that 50% up front,

8436
04:21:24,560 --> 04:21:25,840
you're immediately covering what your

8437
04:21:25,840 --> 04:21:27,439
expected costs are going to be. So,

8438
04:21:27,439 --> 04:21:29,040
ideally with the 3x markup, you get a

8439
04:21:29,040 --> 04:21:30,159
little bit more buffer and you're almost

8440
04:21:30,159 --> 04:21:32,319
always in profit. Um, but with this

8441
04:21:32,319 --> 04:21:34,000
structure, if you take that 2x markup,

8442
04:21:34,000 --> 04:21:35,359
you get the 50% up front, you've covered

8443
04:21:35,359 --> 04:21:37,359
your cost, and then 50% on completion.

8444
04:21:37,359 --> 04:21:39,120
But, as I say here, make sure you set

8445
04:21:39,120 --> 04:21:40,720
the terms very clearly in the contract

8446
04:21:40,720 --> 04:21:42,640
on what is defined as completion. So,

8447
04:21:42,640 --> 04:21:44,159
that's a whole other story. I can do a

8448
04:21:44,159 --> 04:21:46,560
video on contracts if you want, but um

8449
04:21:46,560 --> 04:21:47,920
make sure that you've clearly stated

8450
04:21:47,920 --> 04:21:49,840
what the end uh deliverable or end

8451
04:21:49,840 --> 04:21:51,120
result is so you don't get pissed around

8452
04:21:51,120 --> 04:21:52,399
on that final payment. And just to

8453
04:21:52,399 --> 04:21:53,680
reiterate, the most important thing out

8454
04:21:53,680 --> 04:21:54,960
of this whole video that I want you to

8455
04:21:54,960 --> 04:21:56,640
take away is that experience is more

8456
04:21:56,640 --> 04:21:57,920
valuable than money when you're starting

8457
04:21:57,920 --> 04:21:59,840
out. It's really the only way to succeed

8458
04:21:59,840 --> 04:22:01,680
in this long term. And if you don't

8459
04:22:01,680 --> 04:22:02,960
understand that and you don't change

8460
04:22:02,960 --> 04:22:04,399
your approach, you're going to run into

8461
04:22:04,399 --> 04:22:05,840
failure after failure after failure

8462
04:22:05,840 --> 04:22:07,279
because you're trying to shoot too high

8463
04:22:07,279 --> 04:22:08,880
for your current skill level and then

8464
04:22:08,880 --> 04:22:10,000
basically causing a whole bunch of

8465
04:22:10,000 --> 04:22:11,520
issues for yourself and your business

8466
04:22:11,520 --> 04:22:12,880
and your clients, too. Make sure that

8467
04:22:12,880 --> 04:22:14,080
you're taking on lowc cost or free

8468
04:22:14,080 --> 04:22:15,359
projects to build case studies and

8469
04:22:15,359 --> 04:22:16,960
experience early on. Collect

8470
04:22:16,960 --> 04:22:18,319
testimonials from these early projects

8471
04:22:18,319 --> 04:22:21,120
and the data of before and after of the

8472
04:22:21,120 --> 04:22:22,479
real impact that you're providing to

8473
04:22:22,479 --> 04:22:24,000
your clients so that you can prove that

8474
04:22:24,000 --> 04:22:25,199
you can create value for other

8475
04:22:25,199 --> 04:22:27,199
businesses, too. Um, and my final point

8476
04:22:27,199 --> 04:22:28,960
here is that every idiot right now

8477
04:22:28,960 --> 04:22:30,399
thinks that they're an AI expert just

8478
04:22:30,399 --> 04:22:31,760
because they play around with chat GPT

8479
04:22:31,760 --> 04:22:33,760
and Claude. Um, despite having no

8480
04:22:33,760 --> 04:22:35,199
experience of actually delivering these

8481
04:22:35,199 --> 04:22:37,199
things for businesses. So successful

8482
04:22:37,199 --> 04:22:38,960
deliveries early on and even into the

8483
04:22:38,960 --> 04:22:41,040
later stages of your AI automation

8484
04:22:41,040 --> 04:22:42,800
agency journey. These successful

8485
04:22:42,800 --> 04:22:44,399
deliveries are really the gold in the

8486
04:22:44,399 --> 04:22:46,399
space and should be your number one goal

8487
04:22:46,399 --> 04:22:48,720
early on. It's just can I get a handful

8488
04:22:48,720 --> 04:22:50,479
of successful deliveries under my belt

8489
04:22:50,479 --> 04:22:52,239
to see things through to completion to

8490
04:22:52,239 --> 04:22:53,600
work with clients and get experience in

8491
04:22:53,600 --> 04:22:55,120
dealing with them and then have the data

8492
04:22:55,120 --> 04:22:56,720
that I can use to go and increase the

8493
04:22:56,720 --> 04:22:58,399
prices of my services as you continue to

8494
04:22:58,399 --> 04:23:00,159
take on more clients. Quick recap of the

8495
04:23:00,159 --> 04:23:01,760
key takeaways in this video. We have

8496
04:23:01,760 --> 04:23:03,439
experience coming first. Prioritize

8497
04:23:03,439 --> 04:23:05,040
gaining experience and case studies over

8498
04:23:05,040 --> 04:23:06,560
immediate profits, which is easy to do

8499
04:23:06,560 --> 04:23:08,800
as a beginner. Take free or lowc cost

8500
04:23:08,800 --> 04:23:10,159
projects to build experience and

8501
04:23:10,159 --> 04:23:12,000
ultimately build trust and proof.

8502
04:23:12,000 --> 04:23:14,080
Secondly, cost plus pricing. So after a

8503
04:23:14,080 --> 04:23:15,600
few successes, you can add profit to

8504
04:23:15,600 --> 04:23:17,520
your rate by using cost plus pricing

8505
04:23:17,520 --> 04:23:19,600
with a 2x markup initially. Thirdly,

8506
04:23:19,600 --> 04:23:21,439
structure your deals with a 50% upfront

8507
04:23:21,439 --> 04:23:24,159
and 50% on completion uh structure to

8508
04:23:24,159 --> 04:23:25,920
cover cost and reduce risks initially.

8509
04:23:25,920 --> 04:23:27,439
Number four, experience plus skills

8510
04:23:27,439 --> 04:23:29,120
equals value. Your skills and experience

8511
04:23:29,120 --> 04:23:30,800
define your value. Increase your rates

8512
04:23:30,800 --> 04:23:32,720
as you grow. And finally, keep it

8513
04:23:32,720 --> 04:23:34,880
simple. Start with basic no code or low

8514
04:23:34,880 --> 04:23:36,319
code projects depending on your skill

8515
04:23:36,319 --> 04:23:37,680
level. If you're a developer coming and

8516
04:23:37,680 --> 04:23:38,960
obviously you can jump up a bit higher

8517
04:23:38,960 --> 04:23:40,640
in order to minimize your costs and

8518
04:23:40,640 --> 04:23:42,399
reduce the complexity of your builds and

8519
04:23:42,399 --> 04:23:43,680
really accelerate your learning before

8520
04:23:43,680 --> 04:23:45,199
you start tackling complex projects

8521
04:23:45,199 --> 04:23:46,479
which are definitely out there. And this

8522
04:23:46,479 --> 04:23:47,840
video is only really just scratching the

8523
04:23:47,840 --> 04:23:49,920
surface on AI automation agency pricing.

8524
04:23:49,920 --> 04:23:51,359
There's a lot more to it. Retainers

8525
04:23:51,359 --> 04:23:53,279
versus upfronts, pricing per milestone,

8526
04:23:53,279 --> 04:23:54,880
cost plus versus valuebased pricing,

8527
04:23:54,880 --> 04:23:56,800
data collection for price maxing and

8528
04:23:56,800 --> 04:23:58,319
more. There's so much left to it. I

8529
04:23:58,319 --> 04:23:59,760
really had to exclude a lot out of this

8530
04:23:59,760 --> 04:24:01,359
just to keep this short and sweet for

8531
04:24:01,359 --> 04:24:02,479
beginners. But if you want to learn

8532
04:24:02,479 --> 04:24:03,680
about these topics, you can firstly

8533
04:24:03,680 --> 04:24:04,720
subscribe to the channel because I might

8534
04:24:04,720 --> 04:24:06,319
make some videos on it later. Actually,

8535
04:24:06,319 --> 04:24:07,520
drop a comment below if you want me to

8536
04:24:07,520 --> 04:24:08,720
make any of those videos or these parts

8537
04:24:08,720 --> 04:24:09,600
of it that you're particularly

8538
04:24:09,600 --> 04:24:10,640
interested in. And if you haven't

8539
04:24:10,640 --> 04:24:12,159
already, join my free school community,

8540
04:24:12,159 --> 04:24:13,520
which is my first link in the

8541
04:24:13,520 --> 04:24:15,120
description below where I've got a free

8542
04:24:15,120 --> 04:24:16,479
course on starting an AI automation

8543
04:24:16,479 --> 04:24:18,399
agency that I've just released. So,

8544
04:24:18,399 --> 04:24:19,600
everything you need to start your AI

8545
04:24:19,600 --> 04:24:21,439
automation agency is in there. So, if

8546
04:24:21,439 --> 04:24:22,399
you haven't already joined the school,

8547
04:24:22,399 --> 04:24:23,760
first thing in the description. That's

8548
04:24:23,760 --> 04:24:25,479
all for the video,

8549
04:24:25,479 --> 04:24:27,720
guys.

8550
04:24:27,720 --> 04:24:30,159
Over the past 18 months of running my

8551
04:24:30,159 --> 04:24:32,319
own AI automation agency, Morningside

8552
04:24:32,319 --> 04:24:34,640
AI, I've sent out literally hundreds of

8553
04:24:34,640 --> 04:24:36,319
contracts and only ever had one dispute

8554
04:24:36,319 --> 04:24:37,840
with a client. And that dispute was

8555
04:24:37,840 --> 04:24:40,000
resolved positively in our favor thanks

8556
04:24:40,000 --> 04:24:42,080
to a rockolid contract. In this video,

8557
04:24:42,080 --> 04:24:43,520
I'll walk you through the exact contract

8558
04:24:43,520 --> 04:24:45,120
template that I used to get Morningside

8559
04:24:45,120 --> 04:24:48,000
AI off the ground in early 2023 and show

8560
04:24:48,000 --> 04:24:49,439
you how you can use it to start your own

8561
04:24:49,439 --> 04:24:51,920
AI automation agency safely. Firstly,

8562
04:24:51,920 --> 04:24:53,840
I'll debunk the biggest contract myths

8563
04:24:53,840 --> 04:24:56,000
that really trip up beginners early on.

8564
04:24:56,000 --> 04:24:57,279
And then we'll dive into the template,

8565
04:24:57,279 --> 04:24:58,640
breaking down each section and how you

8566
04:24:58,640 --> 04:25:00,319
can modify it for your own clients and

8567
04:25:00,319 --> 04:25:02,000
your own projects. So, what exactly is a

8568
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:03,199
contract and why do we need them? So,

8569
04:25:03,199 --> 04:25:04,399
contracts are a legally binding

8570
04:25:04,399 --> 04:25:06,000
agreement between yourself and a client.

8571
04:25:06,000 --> 04:25:07,600
And it's a way of both protecting your

8572
04:25:07,600 --> 04:25:09,279
client and also protecting yourself and

8573
04:25:09,279 --> 04:25:10,800
very clearly stating what the scope of

8574
04:25:10,800 --> 04:25:12,080
work is going to be and what you're

8575
04:25:12,080 --> 04:25:13,439
building for them, what compensation you

8576
04:25:13,439 --> 04:25:15,120
expect, etc. So, there's really a couple

8577
04:25:15,120 --> 04:25:16,159
key parts with that you're going to see

8578
04:25:16,159 --> 04:25:17,520
on the template in a second. But, it

8579
04:25:17,520 --> 04:25:19,040
comes down to things like the scope of

8580
04:25:19,040 --> 04:25:20,720
work, what you're actually expected to

8581
04:25:20,720 --> 04:25:22,000
be delivering, what are the

8582
04:25:22,000 --> 04:25:23,840
deliverables. You have the compensation,

8583
04:25:23,840 --> 04:25:25,359
the total amount, and then the payment

8584
04:25:25,359 --> 04:25:27,680
terms. Say it's going to be $5,000 split

8585
04:25:27,680 --> 04:25:30,479
into two payments, 50% up front, and 50%

8586
04:25:30,479 --> 04:25:32,239
um at completion. And contracts often

8587
04:25:32,239 --> 04:25:33,680
need to include things like what's

8588
04:25:33,680 --> 04:25:35,359
expected from the client, not just your

8589
04:25:35,359 --> 04:25:36,720
deliverables and the things that you are

8590
04:25:36,720 --> 04:25:38,720
delivering, but hey, we need access to

8591
04:25:38,720 --> 04:25:40,479
your software. We need access to your

8592
04:25:40,479 --> 04:25:42,399
team. We need responses and and stuff

8593
04:25:42,399 --> 04:25:43,840
back from their end. we need you to

8594
04:25:43,840 --> 04:25:46,000
provide your API key, etc. So, not only

8595
04:25:46,000 --> 04:25:47,600
is it to clearly lay out what you're

8596
04:25:47,600 --> 04:25:49,439
expected to do, but also the agreement

8597
04:25:49,439 --> 04:25:50,560
on the client side and what they're

8598
04:25:50,560 --> 04:25:51,680
bringing to the table in terms of

8599
04:25:51,680 --> 04:25:53,680
compensation, the payment structure and

8600
04:25:53,680 --> 04:25:54,960
things that they need to provide to you

8601
04:25:54,960 --> 04:25:56,960
for successful delivery of the scope of

8602
04:25:56,960 --> 04:25:58,479
work within the contract. So, the most

8603
04:25:58,479 --> 04:25:59,520
important thing you need to understand

8604
04:25:59,520 --> 04:26:01,040
as a beginner when it comes to contracts

8605
04:26:01,040 --> 04:26:02,880
and getting into business is that at the

8606
04:26:02,880 --> 04:26:04,640
end of the day, a contract is just a

8607
04:26:04,640 --> 04:26:06,399
piece of paper. Yes, they are legally

8608
04:26:06,399 --> 04:26:08,640
binding and technically you can if they

8609
04:26:08,640 --> 04:26:09,600
have signed it and you have signed it

8610
04:26:09,600 --> 04:26:10,720
and there's a clear breach of the

8611
04:26:10,720 --> 04:26:12,399
contract, you can go and try to enforce

8612
04:26:12,399 --> 04:26:14,080
the law on them and say they broke the

8613
04:26:14,080 --> 04:26:16,000
contract. But there is also an aspect of

8614
04:26:16,000 --> 04:26:18,080
practicality involved where say if this

8615
04:26:18,080 --> 04:26:20,159
is a $5,000 contract, the effort for you

8616
04:26:20,159 --> 04:26:22,399
to go and seek the the power of the law

8617
04:26:22,399 --> 04:26:23,600
or go to the government and try to get

8618
04:26:23,600 --> 04:26:24,960
this enforced and saying, "Hey, they

8619
04:26:24,960 --> 04:26:27,600
haven't paid me my second $2,500 the

8620
04:26:27,600 --> 04:26:28,960
second part of the contract." It is just

8621
04:26:28,960 --> 04:26:30,399
not worth the effort on your part. you

8622
04:26:30,399 --> 04:26:31,920
would likely need to spend a ton of

8623
04:26:31,920 --> 04:26:34,159
money in legal fees just to be able to

8624
04:26:34,159 --> 04:26:36,479
go and reclaim that $2,500 from them.

8625
04:26:36,479 --> 04:26:38,080
So, important thing, most important

8626
04:26:38,080 --> 04:26:39,040
thing you must understand with

8627
04:26:39,040 --> 04:26:40,159
contracts. They're just a piece of

8628
04:26:40,159 --> 04:26:42,319
paper. People break contracts all the

8629
04:26:42,319 --> 04:26:44,159
time and there's basically nothing you

8630
04:26:44,159 --> 04:26:46,319
can do. So, with this in mind, it's

8631
04:26:46,319 --> 04:26:47,600
like, why would I actually be bothering

8632
04:26:47,600 --> 04:26:48,880
with contracts? Well, you need to have

8633
04:26:48,880 --> 04:26:50,399
that in place because by them signing

8634
04:26:50,399 --> 04:26:52,560
it, you're basically giving the value of

8635
04:26:52,560 --> 04:26:53,840
their word. And this is what you need to

8636
04:26:53,840 --> 04:26:55,680
be looking out for when you are signing

8637
04:26:55,680 --> 04:26:57,760
your first few clients is that shady

8638
04:26:57,760 --> 04:26:58,880
people with a contract, they'll just

8639
04:26:58,880 --> 04:27:00,640
throw that up and and walk away. You

8640
04:27:00,640 --> 04:27:02,159
need to do a bit of a character

8641
04:27:02,159 --> 04:27:03,760
assessment of your client and being

8642
04:27:03,760 --> 04:27:05,279
like, is this person someone who is

8643
04:27:05,279 --> 04:27:07,040
going to once once they put that word

8644
04:27:07,040 --> 04:27:08,239
and the word and their signature on

8645
04:27:08,239 --> 04:27:09,760
their document, do I trust that they're

8646
04:27:09,760 --> 04:27:11,120
going to fulfill their their side of the

8647
04:27:11,120 --> 04:27:12,239
bargain here? So, there is this

8648
04:27:12,239 --> 04:27:13,680
interesting human element to contracts

8649
04:27:13,680 --> 04:27:15,279
early on where you have to essentially

8650
04:27:15,279 --> 04:27:17,199
weigh up the person and say, do I trust

8651
04:27:17,199 --> 04:27:18,399
this person to follow through on what

8652
04:27:18,399 --> 04:27:19,680
they say? But there's also another

8653
04:27:19,680 --> 04:27:21,439
aspect of it of how can I structure this

8654
04:27:21,439 --> 04:27:23,920
contract in a way that protects me from

8655
04:27:23,920 --> 04:27:25,680
the the darker side of human nature

8656
04:27:25,680 --> 04:27:27,199
which exists in all of us in varying

8657
04:27:27,199 --> 04:27:28,720
degrees. But how can I structure this

8658
04:27:28,720 --> 04:27:31,040
deal so that worst case scenario I'm

8659
04:27:31,040 --> 04:27:32,399
still covered or at least covering my

8660
04:27:32,399 --> 04:27:33,439
cost. And that's what we're going to

8661
04:27:33,439 --> 04:27:34,960
jump into in this contract template in a

8662
04:27:34,960 --> 04:27:36,159
second. But that's what you need to

8663
04:27:36,159 --> 04:27:37,760
understand is that contracts are a piece

8664
04:27:37,760 --> 04:27:39,520
of paper. It's only as strong as the

8665
04:27:39,520 --> 04:27:40,800
person's word when you are dealing with

8666
04:27:40,800 --> 04:27:42,800
low ticket well relatively low ticket

8667
04:27:42,800 --> 04:27:44,800
contracts like when you are starting out

8668
04:27:44,800 --> 04:27:46,640
even as you get up to say $50,000 or

8669
04:27:46,640 --> 04:27:49,279
$100,000 projects. the burden for you to

8670
04:27:49,279 --> 04:27:51,040
go and try to enforce that contract or a

8671
04:27:51,040 --> 04:27:53,600
breach of contract is so great that it

8672
04:27:53,600 --> 04:27:55,359
is still not worth it for you to do so

8673
04:27:55,359 --> 04:27:56,560
only when you're dealing with multiple

8674
04:27:56,560 --> 04:27:58,159
six-figure contracts it really becomes

8675
04:27:58,159 --> 04:27:59,760
feasible for you to do that. Um those

8676
04:27:59,760 --> 04:28:01,199
are instances of where you believe that

8677
04:28:01,199 --> 04:28:02,399
they have breached the contract and you

8678
04:28:02,399 --> 04:28:04,399
want to pursue them but they can also

8679
04:28:04,399 --> 04:28:05,680
claim that you have breached the

8680
04:28:05,680 --> 04:28:07,920
contract in their in their eyes and they

8681
04:28:07,920 --> 04:28:09,120
can come and pursue you for it. So you

8682
04:28:09,120 --> 04:28:10,399
need to have a solid contract template

8683
04:28:10,399 --> 04:28:11,760
that you work from and you need to

8684
04:28:11,760 --> 04:28:13,040
clearly define the scope of work which

8685
04:28:13,040 --> 04:28:13,920
is what I'm going to walk you through

8686
04:28:13,920 --> 04:28:15,359
right now. Here on screen is the exact

8687
04:28:15,359 --> 04:28:16,800
contract that we used to get Morningside

8688
04:28:16,800 --> 04:28:18,720
AI off the ground back in early 2023. So

8689
04:28:18,720 --> 04:28:19,520
I'm going to walk you through the

8690
04:28:19,520 --> 04:28:20,560
different parts of it now so you know

8691
04:28:20,560 --> 04:28:22,000
how to use it and modify it and I'll

8692
04:28:22,000 --> 04:28:23,920
tell you how to get access to it. So we

8693
04:28:23,920 --> 04:28:25,600
have the software development agreement.

8694
04:28:25,600 --> 04:28:26,960
We have the parties. So it's an

8695
04:28:26,960 --> 04:28:28,479
agreement on the contract date. You see

8696
04:28:28,479 --> 04:28:29,840
all these square brackets. This is what

8697
04:28:29,840 --> 04:28:31,359
you need to replace. And here we have

8698
04:28:31,359 --> 04:28:32,880
the software development company which

8699
04:28:32,880 --> 04:28:34,640
is yourself, you, your name or your

8700
04:28:34,640 --> 04:28:35,760
company name if you're just a sole

8701
04:28:35,760 --> 04:28:37,279
proprietor and you're just doing this on

8702
04:28:37,279 --> 04:28:39,279
your name for now. Then the address of

8703
04:28:39,279 --> 04:28:40,640
your company and you're the consultant

8704
04:28:40,640 --> 04:28:42,239
as you refer to later in the document.

8705
04:28:42,239 --> 04:28:43,600
Here is where you need to send it over

8706
04:28:43,600 --> 04:28:45,279
to your client to fill out their name or

8707
04:28:45,279 --> 04:28:46,960
their company name, their address, etc.

8708
04:28:46,960 --> 04:28:48,159
And so then we get to the services

8709
04:28:48,159 --> 04:28:49,279
section, which is really the most

8710
04:28:49,279 --> 04:28:50,479
important part for you and making sure

8711
04:28:50,479 --> 04:28:52,000
that you clearly define the scope and

8712
04:28:52,000 --> 04:28:53,199
what you're responsible for delivering.

8713
04:28:53,199 --> 04:28:54,319
So here's an example of something you

8714
04:28:54,319 --> 04:28:56,560
might fill out here. Um, build a MVP

8715
04:28:56,560 --> 04:28:57,920
custom launch chatbot that takes

8716
04:28:57,920 --> 04:28:59,199
prospects through a series of questions

8717
04:28:59,199 --> 04:29:00,560
moving towards an objective, eg booking

8718
04:29:00,560 --> 04:29:02,080
a call or purchasing a service, and can

8719
04:29:02,080 --> 04:29:03,439
provide support regarding the company's

8720
04:29:03,439 --> 04:29:05,840
products, general information, da da da.

8721
04:29:05,840 --> 04:29:07,439
The application will be deployable to a

8722
04:29:07,439 --> 04:29:08,720
website widget in the righthand corner

8723
04:29:08,720 --> 04:29:10,479
of the web page. This MVP will be for

8724
04:29:10,479 --> 04:29:12,080
one specific client of the client and

8725
04:29:12,080 --> 04:29:13,520
will have to be duplicated and adjusted

8726
04:29:13,520 --> 04:29:15,199
in future milestones if alternative

8727
04:29:15,199 --> 04:29:16,960
versions are needed. So this is what's

8728
04:29:16,960 --> 04:29:18,560
defined as the scope of these services

8729
04:29:18,560 --> 04:29:20,479
here and it's helpful to do this but

8730
04:29:20,479 --> 04:29:21,680
also you can add in some bullet points

8731
04:29:21,680 --> 04:29:23,600
as well. This is for a very basic build.

8732
04:29:23,600 --> 04:29:25,600
Um you can provide a lot more detail and

8733
04:29:25,600 --> 04:29:26,960
very clearly state out the milestones

8734
04:29:26,960 --> 04:29:28,319
and the deliverables required. So then

8735
04:29:28,319 --> 04:29:29,359
as I mentioned you get onto the

8736
04:29:29,359 --> 04:29:30,479
requirements from the client. So you can

8737
04:29:30,479 --> 04:29:32,000
put in here like we need access to this

8738
04:29:32,000 --> 04:29:34,319
or this. We need your API key. We need

8739
04:29:34,319 --> 04:29:35,840
you to join our Slack and answer their

8740
04:29:35,840 --> 04:29:37,520
onboarding questionnaire etc. The term

8741
04:29:37,520 --> 04:29:38,720
here is pretty straightforward. when

8742
04:29:38,720 --> 04:29:39,840
you're going to start the project and

8743
04:29:39,840 --> 04:29:41,520
start building for them and when it's

8744
04:29:41,520 --> 04:29:42,640
going to end. You can select one of

8745
04:29:42,640 --> 04:29:44,560
these on the date and then add in a date

8746
04:29:44,560 --> 04:29:45,600
that you want to end on. There's other

8747
04:29:45,600 --> 04:29:46,880
options here you can use. This one here

8748
04:29:46,880 --> 04:29:47,960
is the main one you're going to be

8749
04:29:47,960 --> 04:29:50,319
using. Then compensation is how you get

8750
04:29:50,319 --> 04:29:52,239
paid in consideration for the services

8751
04:29:52,239 --> 04:29:53,760
provided. The consultant is to be paid

8752
04:29:53,760 --> 04:29:55,760
in the following manner uh per hour,

8753
04:29:55,760 --> 04:29:57,040
which is likely not what you're going to

8754
04:29:57,040 --> 04:29:59,439
be doing per job contract value. So you

8755
04:29:59,439 --> 04:30:02,880
can add in say uh $2,000 here in total.

8756
04:30:02,880 --> 04:30:04,560
And so this is the total compensation.

8757
04:30:04,560 --> 04:30:06,000
And then you have the payment terms down

8758
04:30:06,000 --> 04:30:07,359
here. So, the consultant shall be paid

8759
04:30:07,359 --> 04:30:09,439
in accordance with section 4 on a

8760
04:30:09,439 --> 04:30:11,520
weekly, monthly, quarterly basis, etc.

8761
04:30:11,520 --> 04:30:13,040
And then I have other as an option down

8762
04:30:13,040 --> 04:30:14,800
here, which you'll typically want to go

8763
04:30:14,800 --> 04:30:18,199
when you're starting out, uh 50%

8764
04:30:18,199 --> 04:30:22,479
upfront, 50% on completion. And these

8765
04:30:22,479 --> 04:30:23,760
payment terms are great to get started.

8766
04:30:23,760 --> 04:30:25,040
You get your money up front to cover

8767
04:30:25,040 --> 04:30:26,720
your costs, and then 50% when you

8768
04:30:26,720 --> 04:30:27,840
actually deliver the value you said

8769
04:30:27,840 --> 04:30:29,439
you're going to deliver. Um, I've just

8770
04:30:29,439 --> 04:30:30,800
done a whole video on pricing, which if

8771
04:30:30,800 --> 04:30:31,680
you haven't seen it, if you're a

8772
04:30:31,680 --> 04:30:32,720
beginner getting started, you really

8773
04:30:32,720 --> 04:30:33,840
need to understand it. I'll put it up

8774
04:30:33,840 --> 04:30:35,600
here somewhere. um really important you

8775
04:30:35,600 --> 04:30:36,960
understand how to properly price your

8776
04:30:36,960 --> 04:30:38,080
services when you're getting started.

8777
04:30:38,080 --> 04:30:39,359
Then we have a quick section on

8778
04:30:39,359 --> 04:30:40,960
expenses. Um so either you're going to

8779
04:30:40,960 --> 04:30:42,960
be responsible for all of them um in the

8780
04:30:42,960 --> 04:30:44,720
delivery or you can opt to be reimbursed

8781
04:30:44,720 --> 04:30:46,000
with the client for some expenses. So

8782
04:30:46,000 --> 04:30:48,080
you can say hey look we'll set it up on

8783
04:30:48,080 --> 04:30:49,840
our service initially and we'll set it

8784
04:30:49,840 --> 04:30:51,439
up on our API key but at the end of the

8785
04:30:51,439 --> 04:30:52,560
project we're going to expect you to

8786
04:30:52,560 --> 04:30:54,479
reimburse us for the cost incurred to do

8787
04:30:54,479 --> 04:30:56,800
that. So in most cases um if you're just

8788
04:30:56,800 --> 04:30:58,560
doing a upfront build where you build it

8789
04:30:58,560 --> 04:31:00,479
and then sort of leave um you're going

8790
04:31:00,479 --> 04:31:02,080
to be responsible for all expenses and

8791
04:31:02,080 --> 04:31:03,520
you include those expenses as part of

8792
04:31:03,520 --> 04:31:04,880
your pricing. Then you have a dispute

8793
04:31:04,880 --> 04:31:05,840
section. So you can change the

8794
04:31:05,840 --> 04:31:07,520
jurisdiction to be in your country that

8795
04:31:07,520 --> 04:31:09,199
you'd want to be handling any disputes

8796
04:31:09,199 --> 04:31:11,199
in legal notice and then a lot of other

8797
04:31:11,199 --> 04:31:12,720
legal jargon. Then again you've got a

8798
04:31:12,720 --> 04:31:14,000
governing law section where you need to

8799
04:31:14,000 --> 04:31:15,279
change this to your country or your

8800
04:31:15,279 --> 04:31:16,399
state. Then of course down the bottom

8801
04:31:16,399 --> 04:31:17,760
here we have a section for your

8802
04:31:17,760 --> 04:31:19,520
signature. So your signature here then

8803
04:31:19,520 --> 04:31:21,040
the clients you can send this over

8804
04:31:21,040 --> 04:31:22,640
docyign is typically how you do it. I

8805
04:31:22,640 --> 04:31:24,000
think you do get 10 contracts for free

8806
04:31:24,000 --> 04:31:25,279
with docyign. So you can sign up with

8807
04:31:25,279 --> 04:31:27,040
docyign. Put a link down below. Not

8808
04:31:27,040 --> 04:31:28,720
affiliated. Um but you can also just

8809
04:31:28,720 --> 04:31:30,319
send it to them um and get them to sign

8810
04:31:30,319 --> 04:31:31,840
it on the on their PDF viewer on their

8811
04:31:31,840 --> 04:31:33,520
Mac or whatever they're using. Um but

8812
04:31:33,520 --> 04:31:35,279
yeah, docyign generally comes across a

8813
04:31:35,279 --> 04:31:36,560
lot more professional because this kind

8814
04:31:36,560 --> 04:31:38,000
of email they get and then they sign it

8815
04:31:38,000 --> 04:31:39,520
and it's all feels very professional. So

8816
04:31:39,520 --> 04:31:41,439
using this contract and using docyign is

8817
04:31:41,439 --> 04:31:43,040
how we got morning side AI started. And

8818
04:31:43,040 --> 04:31:44,080
of course I do have to add in a

8819
04:31:44,080 --> 04:31:46,000
disclaimer here that I am not a legal

8820
04:31:46,000 --> 04:31:48,000
professional. Um this is what worked for

8821
04:31:48,000 --> 04:31:49,840
us. I'm simply giving a recount of what

8822
04:31:49,840 --> 04:31:51,520
we have done and what worked for Morning

8823
04:31:51,520 --> 04:31:52,960
Side in our early stages. And this is

8824
04:31:52,960 --> 04:31:54,319
the exact template that we use to get

8825
04:31:54,319 --> 04:31:55,680
off the ground. So just as a final note

8826
04:31:55,680 --> 04:31:57,199
on contracts before we wrap up. I know

8827
04:31:57,199 --> 04:31:58,399
it's something that beginners can get

8828
04:31:58,399 --> 04:32:00,720
quite hung up on initially. Um, and I

8829
04:32:00,720 --> 04:32:01,760
really want you to just put that whole

8830
04:32:01,760 --> 04:32:03,680
legality stuff. I need to set up a

8831
04:32:03,680 --> 04:32:05,359
company. I do this all official. Need to

8832
04:32:05,359 --> 04:32:06,960
have all these thousand contracts and a

8833
04:32:06,960 --> 04:32:09,120
lawyer involved. You just need to start,

8834
04:32:09,120 --> 04:32:10,960
man. You just need to take the resources

8835
04:32:10,960 --> 04:32:12,399
that I gave you, like this contract. It

8836
04:32:12,399 --> 04:32:13,920
worked for us. It can work for you. I

8837
04:32:13,920 --> 04:32:15,199
know that. Like I said, contracts are

8838
04:32:15,199 --> 04:32:17,279
really just a formality. This is all you

8839
04:32:17,279 --> 04:32:18,560
need to get off the ground. And then

8840
04:32:18,560 --> 04:32:19,920
later on, you can hire your lawyer once

8841
04:32:19,920 --> 04:32:21,199
you've got some cash flow coming in and

8842
04:32:21,199 --> 04:32:22,800
you can fully rethink it and make sure

8843
04:32:22,800 --> 04:32:23,840
it's really tailored to what you're

8844
04:32:23,840 --> 04:32:25,040
offering. But this is enough to get

8845
04:32:25,040 --> 04:32:27,439
started. Forget that whole fancy legal

8846
04:32:27,439 --> 04:32:29,680
setup rubbish. You just need to focus on

8847
04:32:29,680 --> 04:32:31,120
getting people to give you money. That's

8848
04:32:31,120 --> 04:32:32,399
all it is. That's all starting a

8849
04:32:32,399 --> 04:32:33,520
business is, is getting people to give

8850
04:32:33,520 --> 04:32:35,680
you

8851
04:32:36,840 --> 04:32:38,960
money. Today, I want to make a quick

8852
04:32:38,960 --> 04:32:40,399
video breaking down the three most

8853
04:32:40,399 --> 04:32:42,239
important questions that you need to ask

8854
04:32:42,239 --> 04:32:44,880
before taking on any AI projects to your

8855
04:32:44,880 --> 04:32:46,800
agency. Um, now these questions that

8856
04:32:46,800 --> 04:32:48,319
myself and my team at Morningside have

8857
04:32:48,319 --> 04:32:50,479
had to learn by trial and error. And

8858
04:32:50,479 --> 04:32:52,000
this is what we've come to and continue

8859
04:32:52,000 --> 04:32:53,840
to use to this day after coming up with

8860
04:32:53,840 --> 04:32:55,439
it around a year ago, this time last

8861
04:32:55,439 --> 04:32:57,279
year. um and it continues to be the set

8862
04:32:57,279 --> 04:32:58,880
of questions that we ask during our

8863
04:32:58,880 --> 04:33:00,960
sales process and also as soon as we get

8864
04:33:00,960 --> 04:33:02,560
into the actual building of the project.

8865
04:33:02,560 --> 04:33:04,160
Um that's the the information that we

8866
04:33:04,160 --> 04:33:05,520
need to collect. Very important to

8867
04:33:05,520 --> 04:33:06,879
understand this if you're looking to

8868
04:33:06,879 --> 04:33:08,639
build an AI agency and be successful in

8869
04:33:08,639 --> 04:33:10,639
this space. So let's get into it. So

8870
04:33:10,639 --> 04:33:12,719
three key questions starting off. These

8871
04:33:12,719 --> 04:33:14,320
are things we'll typically ask during

8872
04:33:14,320 --> 04:33:16,240
our sales process initially. And this is

8873
04:33:16,240 --> 04:33:19,039
really how myself and my team figure out

8874
04:33:19,039 --> 04:33:21,438
what a project is about and what the

8875
04:33:21,438 --> 04:33:23,520
goal is, what who the end users are. And

8876
04:33:23,520 --> 04:33:24,879
and these three questions are really

8877
04:33:24,879 --> 04:33:26,000
what allow us to connect all these

8878
04:33:26,000 --> 04:33:27,438
pieces together. So the first thing up

8879
04:33:27,438 --> 04:33:30,118
here is

8880
04:33:30,118 --> 04:33:32,719
data. Now I know data isn't a question,

8881
04:33:32,719 --> 04:33:35,118
but what data is this system or is this

8882
04:33:35,118 --> 04:33:37,039
build going to be using or integrating?

8883
04:33:37,039 --> 04:33:39,199
Um because we're using LLMs and and and

8884
04:33:39,199 --> 04:33:41,520
chatbt APIs, there's some kind of data

8885
04:33:41,520 --> 04:33:42,639
that's going to be flowing through and

8886
04:33:42,639 --> 04:33:44,240
hitting that API at some point and we're

8887
04:33:44,240 --> 04:33:45,278
going to be manipulating it. We're going

8888
04:33:45,278 --> 04:33:46,400
to be doing something with it. It might

8889
04:33:46,400 --> 04:33:48,719
be a custom knowledge chatbot. It might

8890
04:33:48,719 --> 04:33:50,561
be an automation where we're passing

8891
04:33:50,561 --> 04:33:52,480
some kind of data through it. we need to

8892
04:33:52,480 --> 04:33:54,799
know what data they're going to be using

8893
04:33:54,799 --> 04:33:56,240
in the system or what we're going to be

8894
04:33:56,240 --> 04:33:58,400
manipulating with our AI tasks and with

8895
04:33:58,400 --> 04:34:00,400
our functions. So, first things first is

8896
04:34:00,400 --> 04:34:02,240
data. What data are you using or what

8897
04:34:02,240 --> 04:34:03,799
data is going to be built into the

8898
04:34:03,799 --> 04:34:08,560
system? Um, next we have

8899
04:34:09,160 --> 04:34:11,840
inputs. So, what are the expected inputs

8900
04:34:11,840 --> 04:34:13,599
of the system? Um whether that's an

8901
04:34:13,599 --> 04:34:14,958
email classification system where it's

8902
04:34:14,958 --> 04:34:17,118
going to have emails from XYZ inbox that

8903
04:34:17,118 --> 04:34:19,278
are going to be moving through it or

8904
04:34:19,278 --> 04:34:20,958
typically in the form of chat bots and

8905
04:34:20,958 --> 04:34:23,359
agents that you build. Who who's the end

8906
04:34:23,359 --> 04:34:24,561
user of this? How are they actually

8907
04:34:24,561 --> 04:34:25,759
going to be sending questions to it?

8908
04:34:25,759 --> 04:34:26,958
What are they expecting to get out of

8909
04:34:26,958 --> 04:34:29,118
it? This is really important to to

8910
04:34:29,118 --> 04:34:30,561
understand how this data is going to be

8911
04:34:30,561 --> 04:34:33,520
used. Um and then finally um you may

8912
04:34:33,520 --> 04:34:37,039
have guessed it, we have uh

8913
04:34:37,719 --> 04:34:41,958
outputs. So with this we get a nice

8914
04:34:41,958 --> 04:34:44,958
little

8915
04:34:45,561 --> 04:34:48,199
triangulation which allows us to

8916
04:34:48,199 --> 04:34:50,958
understand what this project is and by

8917
04:34:50,958 --> 04:34:53,520
triangulating these different parts um

8918
04:34:53,520 --> 04:34:54,879
we understand what they're looking to

8919
04:34:54,879 --> 04:34:56,160
build because if you know what data

8920
04:34:56,160 --> 04:34:57,680
they're getting they know what questions

8921
04:34:57,680 --> 04:34:58,958
are being asked and you know what

8922
04:34:58,958 --> 04:35:00,958
they're trying to output then you have a

8923
04:35:00,958 --> 04:35:03,039
full picture of okay this is what the

8924
04:35:03,039 --> 04:35:05,118
system is doing I'm using AI or language

8925
04:35:05,118 --> 04:35:07,759
models to convert this data given this

8926
04:35:07,759 --> 04:35:11,359
prompt into this output. Now, this may

8927
04:35:11,359 --> 04:35:12,958
look like in the form of okay, I'm going

8928
04:35:12,958 --> 04:35:16,520
to be using CSV or I'm going to be using

8929
04:35:16,520 --> 04:35:18,561
PDFs. Okay, well, what are in those

8930
04:35:18,561 --> 04:35:20,639
PDFs? Is it diagrams? Is it going to be

8931
04:35:20,639 --> 04:35:22,639
just all text? What is the content of

8932
04:35:22,639 --> 04:35:24,561
the PDF? And how big are they? All these

8933
04:35:24,561 --> 04:35:25,840
kind of questions that you need to ask

8934
04:35:25,840 --> 04:35:27,278
about the data that's going into the

8935
04:35:27,278 --> 04:35:28,958
system. And then for the inputs, we'll

8936
04:35:28,958 --> 04:35:32,480
just ask for a list.

8937
04:35:32,480 --> 04:35:35,278
give us a list of 5 to 10 expected

8938
04:35:35,278 --> 04:35:37,520
inputs that the user or end user would

8939
04:35:37,520 --> 04:35:39,118
end up giving to the system. Okay,

8940
04:35:39,118 --> 04:35:41,118
great. We've got a list of those. Okay,

8941
04:35:41,118 --> 04:35:44,359
now can we also get a list of

8942
04:35:44,359 --> 04:35:46,799
outputs? If we get a list of inputs and

8943
04:35:46,799 --> 04:35:48,561
a list of outputs and then we know the

8944
04:35:48,561 --> 04:35:51,359
data that we need to put in, we can then

8945
04:35:51,359 --> 04:35:54,080
run some kind of test. Sorry, there's

8946
04:35:54,080 --> 04:35:55,599
another triangle, but this is supposed

8947
04:35:55,599 --> 04:35:57,438
to be the system that we put into it.

8948
04:35:57,438 --> 04:35:58,879
Um, it's flowing the wrong way, but you

8949
04:35:58,879 --> 04:36:02,000
get the idea. we can put the inputs into

8950
04:36:02,000 --> 04:36:04,240
this and test the outputs. So we use

8951
04:36:04,240 --> 04:36:05,840
these questions at various stages of our

8952
04:36:05,840 --> 04:36:07,520
client life cycle. So in the discovery

8953
04:36:07,520 --> 04:36:09,199
call, we'll ask these questions. What

8954
04:36:09,199 --> 04:36:10,958
data is the system going to be using or

8955
04:36:10,958 --> 04:36:12,561
manipulating? What are the expected

8956
04:36:12,561 --> 04:36:13,840
inputs? What are some of the expected

8957
04:36:13,840 --> 04:36:15,278
outputs that you want from that data

8958
04:36:15,278 --> 04:36:17,039
given these inputs? We get the full

8959
04:36:17,039 --> 04:36:19,118
picture. Um but then we can go into our

8960
04:36:19,118 --> 04:36:20,639
exploration phase, which I've covered in

8961
04:36:20,639 --> 04:36:21,759
the in the earlier video that I

8962
04:36:21,759 --> 04:36:23,599
mentioned. And the exploration phase is

8963
04:36:23,599 --> 04:36:27,199
a $800,000 $2,000 milestone. And we've

8964
04:36:27,199 --> 04:36:28,320
continued to increase the price over

8965
04:36:28,320 --> 04:36:30,561
time and you guys can too. Uh but it's a

8966
04:36:30,561 --> 04:36:32,080
a quick milestone that allows us to say,

8967
04:36:32,080 --> 04:36:34,240
"Okay, give us a sample of the data.

8968
04:36:34,240 --> 04:36:35,759
Give us some sample inputs. Give us some

8969
04:36:35,759 --> 04:36:37,919
sample outputs. Let us mock up a quick

8970
04:36:37,919 --> 04:36:39,599
system, a prototype of the system." Cuz

8971
04:36:39,599 --> 04:36:41,520
with LLM apps, it's usually fairly easy

8972
04:36:41,520 --> 04:36:42,958
to get a prototype up or at least a

8973
04:36:42,958 --> 04:36:44,799
proof of concept that shows, okay, yes,

8974
04:36:44,799 --> 04:36:46,561
we can achieve this or we can get to

8975
04:36:46,561 --> 04:36:48,561
close enough to the end result that we

8976
04:36:48,561 --> 04:36:50,561
can be confident in in the outputs or or

8977
04:36:50,561 --> 04:36:51,919
in the final result being there if we

8978
04:36:51,919 --> 04:36:53,680
put in a bit of extra work. So we

8979
04:36:53,680 --> 04:36:54,799
collect the data, we collect the inputs

8980
04:36:54,799 --> 04:36:56,240
and outputs. We run a little exploration

8981
04:36:56,240 --> 04:36:57,359
milestone and then we can actually do

8982
04:36:57,359 --> 04:37:00,639
some cosign similarity

8983
04:37:00,759 --> 04:37:03,359
testing to determine if we're able to

8984
04:37:03,359 --> 04:37:04,879
make this thing work. So yes, we've had

8985
04:37:04,879 --> 04:37:06,080
on the discovery call, we've learned

8986
04:37:06,080 --> 04:37:07,840
about it. Is this something like

8987
04:37:07,840 --> 04:37:09,520
initially is this a project that we're

8988
04:37:09,520 --> 04:37:11,359
interested in taking on. Is this data

8989
04:37:11,359 --> 04:37:13,759
too tricky? Is it CSV or is it PDS with

8990
04:37:13,759 --> 04:37:15,438
images in it? Is this data too tricky

8991
04:37:15,438 --> 04:37:17,118
for the current technology? So if it's

8992
04:37:17,118 --> 04:37:18,480
not, then we say, okay, sorry, we're not

8993
04:37:18,480 --> 04:37:20,000
interested in that project. But if they

8994
04:37:20,000 --> 04:37:23,118
get past step one and they get they

8995
04:37:23,118 --> 04:37:25,278
become a client. Okay, now we have this

8996
04:37:25,278 --> 04:37:26,958
discovery milestone which is step two.

8997
04:37:26,958 --> 04:37:29,118
Okay, we can do this little test. Does

8998
04:37:29,118 --> 04:37:30,799
this does these inputs and the data are

8999
04:37:30,799 --> 04:37:32,879
we able to get a proof of concept or or

9000
04:37:32,879 --> 04:37:34,480
prototype up? Okay, yes, we've moved

9001
04:37:34,480 --> 04:37:36,160
through that. Okay, now we're into stage

9002
04:37:36,160 --> 04:37:38,160
three, which is the actual build and we

9003
04:37:38,160 --> 04:37:39,438
need to go through and flesh this thing

9004
04:37:39,438 --> 04:37:41,199
out and really get down to this desired

9005
04:37:41,199 --> 04:37:42,639
set of outputs. And we build these into

9006
04:37:42,639 --> 04:37:44,160
the contract. This concept of these

9007
04:37:44,160 --> 04:37:46,080
three questions that we ask to get a a a

9008
04:37:46,080 --> 04:37:47,680
holistic idea of the project that we're

9009
04:37:47,680 --> 04:37:50,561
taking on is not just limited to to this

9010
04:37:50,561 --> 04:37:52,160
stuff here. It's actually part of a

9011
04:37:52,160 --> 04:37:54,599
broader broader issue and

9012
04:37:54,599 --> 04:37:57,680
and thorny part of of running these AI

9013
04:37:57,680 --> 04:37:59,278
agencies and building AI solutions to

9014
04:37:59,278 --> 04:38:01,240
businesses and that

9015
04:38:01,240 --> 04:38:05,118
is expectation management. And this is

9016
04:38:05,118 --> 04:38:07,520
something that continually will rear its

9017
04:38:07,520 --> 04:38:10,000
head in your journey and continue to

9018
04:38:10,000 --> 04:38:12,879
cause issues if you are not absolutely

9019
04:38:12,879 --> 04:38:15,599
brutal on your attempts to squash it and

9020
04:38:15,599 --> 04:38:17,520
shut it down and get yourself and your

9021
04:38:17,520 --> 04:38:21,039
client on the exact same uh eye level of

9022
04:38:21,039 --> 04:38:22,561
of what this project and what the

9023
04:38:22,561 --> 04:38:23,759
project will look like in its final

9024
04:38:23,759 --> 04:38:25,359
form. So when it comes to expectation

9025
04:38:25,359 --> 04:38:27,359
management, those three questions are so

9026
04:38:27,359 --> 04:38:28,400
key cuz initially you're going to be

9027
04:38:28,400 --> 04:38:29,759
able to say yes or no, we can do the

9028
04:38:29,759 --> 04:38:31,278
project. Great on the discovery call,

9029
04:38:31,278 --> 04:38:32,240
sales call, whatever you want to call

9030
04:38:32,240 --> 04:38:34,320
it. That gets you into the exploration

9031
04:38:34,320 --> 04:38:35,680
phase when you can say okay now we're

9032
04:38:35,680 --> 04:38:37,599
going to try to do a prototype test this

9033
04:38:37,599 --> 04:38:39,118
see if we can get the kind of outputs we

9034
04:38:39,118 --> 04:38:40,719
want using coine similarity check that

9035
04:38:40,719 --> 04:38:42,160
they're similar enough then we can move

9036
04:38:42,160 --> 04:38:44,639
into the final project but before you go

9037
04:38:44,639 --> 04:38:46,320
any further you need to really be

9038
04:38:46,320 --> 04:38:48,240
careful about setting these expectations

9039
04:38:48,240 --> 04:38:49,759
correctly which is using the cosine

9040
04:38:49,759 --> 04:38:51,039
similarity test so that's one of the

9041
04:38:51,039 --> 04:38:53,118
techniques we use cosine so cosine

9042
04:38:53,118 --> 04:38:54,799
similarity test during their exploration

9043
04:38:54,799 --> 04:38:56,639
phase and that's going to let them know

9044
04:38:56,639 --> 04:38:58,160
hey these are the kind of outputs we can

9045
04:38:58,160 --> 04:39:00,320
get from this exploration phase we did

9046
04:39:00,320 --> 04:39:02,080
you show them very very clearly and we

9047
04:39:02,080 --> 04:39:03,840
do this morning side every time do the

9048
04:39:03,840 --> 04:39:05,759
exploration, get the proof of concept,

9049
04:39:05,759 --> 04:39:07,359
get the prototype, generate a set of

9050
04:39:07,359 --> 04:39:08,879
outputs, hop on a call with the client

9051
04:39:08,879 --> 04:39:10,719
and say, "Are you happy with these

9052
04:39:10,719 --> 04:39:12,080
outputs?" Everything is based on

9053
04:39:12,080 --> 04:39:13,840
language. Everything is subjective and

9054
04:39:13,840 --> 04:39:15,199
they will have opinions and feelings.

9055
04:39:15,199 --> 04:39:16,799
And again, you can't build a business

9056
04:39:16,799 --> 04:39:19,359
based on the the whims and feelings of

9057
04:39:19,359 --> 04:39:20,879
your clients. You need to have something

9058
04:39:20,879 --> 04:39:22,320
more solid than that or you're going to

9059
04:39:22,320 --> 04:39:24,400
be dead in the water. So co similarity

9060
04:39:24,400 --> 04:39:26,080
test at the end of that exploration

9061
04:39:26,080 --> 04:39:27,840
showing that yes we've met the input and

9062
04:39:27,840 --> 04:39:30,561
output requirements to to be similar but

9063
04:39:30,561 --> 04:39:31,840
also showing it to the client and

9064
04:39:31,840 --> 04:39:33,599
getting feedback and saying hey what do

9065
04:39:33,599 --> 04:39:34,958
you think of this this is going to be

9066
04:39:34,958 --> 04:39:36,719
what it looks like in the final version

9067
04:39:36,719 --> 04:39:38,400
can you please confirm that this is what

9068
04:39:38,400 --> 04:39:39,600
you're happy with and that's what we're

9069
04:39:39,600 --> 04:39:41,840
going to use based on the uh the final

9070
04:39:41,840 --> 04:39:43,600
contract is going to be the results like

9071
04:39:43,600 --> 04:39:45,120
this but more recently and something I

9072
04:39:45,120 --> 04:39:46,718
really want to introduce to you guys now

9073
04:39:46,718 --> 04:39:48,560
as as myself and the team at Morningside

9074
04:39:48,560 --> 04:39:50,638
have just started to experiment with it

9075
04:39:50,638 --> 04:39:54,239
but also mock-ups

9076
04:39:56,000 --> 04:39:58,240
where the client will see the end result

9077
04:39:58,240 --> 04:40:00,560
in some kind of graphical mockup of of

9078
04:40:00,560 --> 04:40:02,878
what the display will be like because

9079
04:40:02,878 --> 04:40:04,798
yes, it's one thing to get the outputs,

9080
04:40:04,798 --> 04:40:06,560
but often times you'll send them back

9081
04:40:06,560 --> 04:40:07,920
the outputs and and something that

9082
04:40:07,920 --> 04:40:10,080
doesn't look too flashy. It's it's like

9083
04:40:10,080 --> 04:40:11,600
a bit rough around the edges cuz it's a

9084
04:40:11,600 --> 04:40:12,958
prototype and then they look at it and

9085
04:40:12,958 --> 04:40:14,718
they go, "Oh, that's that's not what I

9086
04:40:14,718 --> 04:40:16,400
wanted at all." Because you hadn't

9087
04:40:16,400 --> 04:40:18,080
managed the expectations of what it was

9088
04:40:18,080 --> 04:40:19,440
going to look like. We're experimenting

9089
04:40:19,440 --> 04:40:21,520
right now with sending over graphical

9090
04:40:21,520 --> 04:40:23,760
mockups and doing a little design and

9091
04:40:23,760 --> 04:40:24,878
sending that over to them and saying,

9092
04:40:24,878 --> 04:40:26,240
"Hey, look, this is what it's going to

9093
04:40:26,240 --> 04:40:28,080
look like. This is how the answers are

9094
04:40:28,080 --> 04:40:30,000
going to be displayed within the window.

9095
04:40:30,000 --> 04:40:32,400
This is what the overall UI of it on

9096
04:40:32,400 --> 04:40:33,840
your website is going to look like,

9097
04:40:33,840 --> 04:40:36,160
etc." Um, so mock-ups and giving some

9098
04:40:36,160 --> 04:40:38,240
kind of flash forward to the end

9099
04:40:38,240 --> 04:40:39,760
product, not just in terms of the

9100
04:40:39,760 --> 04:40:41,840
outputs, but also in in terms of the

9101
04:40:41,840 --> 04:40:43,440
optics and and the visuals of what it's

9102
04:40:43,440 --> 04:40:45,680
going to look like is further going to

9103
04:40:45,680 --> 04:40:47,840
help your expectation management so that

9104
04:40:47,840 --> 04:40:49,200
you don't get to the end and the clients

9105
04:40:49,200 --> 04:40:52,000
go, "Eh, I'm not happy with this." So

9106
04:40:52,000 --> 04:40:53,520
that's all I want to say in this video.

9107
04:40:53,520 --> 04:40:54,958
Expectation management, the three

9108
04:40:54,958 --> 04:40:56,878
questions. What data is the system going

9109
04:40:56,878 --> 04:40:58,560
to use? What are the expected inputs?

9110
04:40:58,560 --> 04:41:00,000
And what are the expected outputs? With

9111
04:41:00,000 --> 04:41:01,920
those three, you can eyeball a project

9112
04:41:01,920 --> 04:41:03,600
very, very clearly. That's that's all I

9113
04:41:03,600 --> 04:41:05,920
use to to survey or analyze a project

9114
04:41:05,920 --> 04:41:07,600
before we take it on. But then when you

9115
04:41:07,600 --> 04:41:09,120
get further down the sales life cycle

9116
04:41:09,120 --> 04:41:11,440
towards an exploration phase, content

9117
04:41:11,440 --> 04:41:13,040
similarity testing and even giving

9118
04:41:13,040 --> 04:41:14,878
mockups just to really manage the

9119
04:41:14,878 --> 04:41:16,638
expectations, show the client that this

9120
04:41:16,638 --> 04:41:17,680
is what you're going to get because

9121
04:41:17,680 --> 04:41:20,400
unfortunately Chat GBT Open AI, they

9122
04:41:20,400 --> 04:41:22,480
have such amazing AI experiences that

9123
04:41:22,480 --> 04:41:24,240
they set the bar way up here. And us as

9124
04:41:24,240 --> 04:41:26,718
AI agency owners, while we love chatbt,

9125
04:41:26,718 --> 04:41:28,480
it is our worst enemy at times because

9126
04:41:28,480 --> 04:41:30,320
it's such a good experience for people

9127
04:41:30,320 --> 04:41:31,920
and they a lot of these early adopters

9128
04:41:31,920 --> 04:41:33,200
that you'll have coming to your agency,

9129
04:41:33,200 --> 04:41:34,718
they use chatbt heavily and they go,

9130
04:41:34,718 --> 04:41:36,160
"Wow, this is really cool. I want

9131
04:41:36,160 --> 04:41:37,200
something like this for my business."

9132
04:41:37,200 --> 04:41:39,040
And then for you as an agency owner with

9133
04:41:39,040 --> 04:41:41,920
one developer trying to replicate CHBT

9134
04:41:41,920 --> 04:41:44,400
level polish is very difficult to do. So

9135
04:41:44,400 --> 04:41:46,480
this is your saving grace. So that's all

9136
04:41:46,480 --> 04:41:48,878
for the video

9137
04:41:49,560 --> 04:41:51,840
guys. Today we're going through how and

9138
04:41:51,840 --> 04:41:53,760
where to hire your first developer as an

9139
04:41:53,760 --> 04:41:55,680
AI agency owner. Now, this is an

9140
04:41:55,680 --> 04:41:57,440
extremely important and crucial step in

9141
04:41:57,440 --> 04:41:59,280
the journey of any AI agency owner

9142
04:41:59,280 --> 04:42:00,638
because if you're not able to get this

9143
04:42:00,638 --> 04:42:02,400
right and and start to bring in external

9144
04:42:02,400 --> 04:42:04,240
talent and expertise into your agency,

9145
04:42:04,240 --> 04:42:05,520
then you are never going to be able to

9146
04:42:05,520 --> 04:42:07,120
free up your time to focus on more

9147
04:42:07,120 --> 04:42:08,400
important things like actually growing

9148
04:42:08,400 --> 04:42:10,080
the business. So, it's so important that

9149
04:42:10,080 --> 04:42:11,680
you get this right. And this is the the

9150
04:42:11,680 --> 04:42:13,360
hurdle that many people never get over

9151
04:42:13,360 --> 04:42:14,958
and stops people from going on to become

9152
04:42:14,958 --> 04:42:16,080
successful with this business model

9153
04:42:16,080 --> 04:42:17,520
longterm. So, I wanted to make this

9154
04:42:17,520 --> 04:42:18,718
video really breaking down everything

9155
04:42:18,718 --> 04:42:20,240
that I've learned over the past 14

9156
04:42:20,240 --> 04:42:21,840
months. And this is going to be probably

9157
04:42:21,840 --> 04:42:22,958
one of the most important videos you

9158
04:42:22,958 --> 04:42:24,400
watch this year if you're serious about

9159
04:42:24,400 --> 04:42:25,600
this business model. So, let's get into

9160
04:42:25,600 --> 04:42:26,878
it. How and where to hire your first

9161
04:42:26,878 --> 04:42:28,798
developer as an AI agency. Firstly, my

9162
04:42:28,798 --> 04:42:30,160
expertise in this topic comes from

9163
04:42:30,160 --> 04:42:32,080
hiring and firing over 15 developers for

9164
04:42:32,080 --> 04:42:34,000
my own agency in the past 15 months,

9165
04:42:34,000 --> 04:42:35,680
which is a bit of a a weird flex, I

9166
04:42:35,680 --> 04:42:37,040
know. Um, but it shows the kind of

9167
04:42:37,040 --> 04:42:38,400
turnover that you can see if you're very

9168
04:42:38,400 --> 04:42:39,840
picky about the kind of talent that you

9169
04:42:39,840 --> 04:42:41,600
let in. And I've learned a lot from from

9170
04:42:41,600 --> 04:42:43,040
going through 15 developers. So key

9171
04:42:43,040 --> 04:42:44,320
takeaways from this video for you is

9172
04:42:44,320 --> 04:42:45,600
firstly going to be determining what

9173
04:42:45,600 --> 04:42:47,600
developer you need for your agency to

9174
04:42:47,600 --> 04:42:49,120
succeed this year. Secondly,

9175
04:42:49,120 --> 04:42:51,200
understanding what makes AAA developers

9176
04:42:51,200 --> 04:42:53,520
different from regular developers. Um

9177
04:42:53,520 --> 04:42:55,840
thirdly, knowing the easiest way to find

9178
04:42:55,840 --> 04:42:57,760
AAA developers for your business. And

9179
04:42:57,760 --> 04:42:59,360
finally, knowing how much to pay your

9180
04:42:59,360 --> 04:43:00,718
developers so you don't get ripped off.

9181
04:43:00,718 --> 04:43:02,080
So very important things. Um we're going

9182
04:43:02,080 --> 04:43:03,200
to get to all of these by the end of the

9183
04:43:03,200 --> 04:43:04,798
video. And here's um DJ Calib with the

9184
04:43:04,798 --> 04:43:06,080
major key. If you are new to the channel

9185
04:43:06,080 --> 04:43:07,440
and don't know who I am, my name is Liam

9186
04:43:07,440 --> 04:43:09,440
Mley. I'm the creator of the AAA or AI

9187
04:43:09,440 --> 04:43:11,120
automation agency model. I'm the founder

9188
04:43:11,120 --> 04:43:12,798
of my own agency, Morningside AI. I've

9189
04:43:12,798 --> 04:43:14,560
generated over seven figures with my AI

9190
04:43:14,560 --> 04:43:16,160
businesses over the past 15 months

9191
04:43:16,160 --> 04:43:17,520
around the largest community of AAA

9192
04:43:17,520 --> 04:43:18,798
owners in the world and I've hired all

9193
04:43:18,798 --> 04:43:20,080
of my friends and live an awesome life

9194
04:43:20,080 --> 04:43:21,520
that all thanks to AI. Just a little bit

9195
04:43:21,520 --> 04:43:23,040
of transparency about why I make these

9196
04:43:23,040 --> 04:43:24,240
videos as well. I know there's a lot of

9197
04:43:24,240 --> 04:43:26,000
skeptics out there now. So, um this is

9198
04:43:26,000 --> 04:43:27,680
it on screen. I have software products

9199
04:43:27,680 --> 04:43:29,520
that I make for AAA owners and my

9200
04:43:29,520 --> 04:43:31,040
community. And if you become a

9201
04:43:31,040 --> 04:43:32,400
successful AAA owner, then you'll become

9202
04:43:32,400 --> 04:43:34,080
a user of my software. And eventually,

9203
04:43:34,080 --> 04:43:35,840
if I do things right, um I can sell my

9204
04:43:35,840 --> 04:43:37,680
software. So without you winning and and

9205
04:43:37,680 --> 04:43:38,958
succeeding with your own agency, you

9206
04:43:38,958 --> 04:43:40,638
will never use my software and I will

9207
04:43:40,638 --> 04:43:42,320
never make the reach my end goal. So

9208
04:43:42,320 --> 04:43:44,560
we're kind of aligned on this. So let's

9209
04:43:44,560 --> 04:43:47,040
do it. So the first thing we need to ask

9210
04:43:47,040 --> 04:43:48,638
ourselves is why are we hiring? What's

9211
04:43:48,638 --> 04:43:50,160
the point of this in the first place? Um

9212
04:43:50,160 --> 04:43:51,600
and this comes down to a few key things.

9213
04:43:51,600 --> 04:43:52,798
So finding and hiring the right

9214
04:43:52,798 --> 04:43:54,560
developer is a crucial step in your

9215
04:43:54,560 --> 04:43:57,200
journey as a AAA owner. Um failure to do

9216
04:43:57,200 --> 04:43:58,718
this and and hire correctly and bring

9217
04:43:58,718 --> 04:44:00,080
expertise into the business so that you

9218
04:44:00,080 --> 04:44:01,680
can work on more important things is the

9219
04:44:01,680 --> 04:44:03,920
killer of many aspiring AAA owners. Um

9220
04:44:03,920 --> 04:44:05,120
they all try to get going. they're doing

9221
04:44:05,120 --> 04:44:06,798
it themselves and they never get find

9222
04:44:06,798 --> 04:44:08,560
the right person or understand how to

9223
04:44:08,560 --> 04:44:09,840
hire in the right way. So, they never

9224
04:44:09,840 --> 04:44:11,600
advance past that where you can actually

9225
04:44:11,600 --> 04:44:13,040
start to free things up and scale the

9226
04:44:13,040 --> 04:44:14,480
business more. Um, and the key thing

9227
04:44:14,480 --> 04:44:16,400
here is that delivering highquality

9228
04:44:16,400 --> 04:44:18,560
services is hard in the AI space. I'm

9229
04:44:18,560 --> 04:44:20,240
not going to sugar coat it. You need to

9230
04:44:20,240 --> 04:44:22,718
have a capable team and capable

9231
04:44:22,718 --> 04:44:24,240
expertise within your within your

9232
04:44:24,240 --> 04:44:26,798
organization to deliver quality services

9233
04:44:26,798 --> 04:44:27,920
because there's so many people trying to

9234
04:44:27,920 --> 04:44:29,200
start this right now. But the number of

9235
04:44:29,200 --> 04:44:30,718
highquality service providers who can

9236
04:44:30,718 --> 04:44:31,760
give a great experience for their

9237
04:44:31,760 --> 04:44:33,760
customers and create value is limited.

9238
04:44:33,760 --> 04:44:35,040
And that's limited to the people who

9239
04:44:35,040 --> 04:44:36,400
have been able to successfully hire and

9240
04:44:36,400 --> 04:44:38,480
delegate it off to capable teams as

9241
04:44:38,480 --> 04:44:40,718
well. And full transparency, this is

9242
04:44:40,718 --> 04:44:42,480
what completely changed my agency from

9243
04:44:42,480 --> 04:44:44,080
us struggling initially. It was bringing

9244
04:44:44,080 --> 04:44:45,680
in the right talent. We had some really

9245
04:44:45,680 --> 04:44:47,200
poor talent initially. And when we hired

9246
04:44:47,200 --> 04:44:48,718
the right people, it just completely

9247
04:44:48,718 --> 04:44:49,840
opened things up for us. I could

9248
04:44:49,840 --> 04:44:51,040
suddenly work on building my personal

9249
04:44:51,040 --> 04:44:52,480
brand further so that we could get more

9250
04:44:52,480 --> 04:44:54,240
leads. And it really just set ourselves

9251
04:44:54,240 --> 04:44:56,080
up for success as we have had over the

9252
04:44:56,080 --> 04:44:57,840
past 12 months. On the right here are

9253
04:44:57,840 --> 04:44:59,040
some examples of people winning within

9254
04:44:59,040 --> 04:45:00,560
my program. And if you're doing these

9255
04:45:00,560 --> 04:45:02,160
$20,000 projects, you have to have some

9256
04:45:02,160 --> 04:45:03,440
kind of talent to deliver this stuff for

9257
04:45:03,440 --> 04:45:04,560
you so that you can focus on more

9258
04:45:04,560 --> 04:45:05,920
important things. So if you want to get

9259
04:45:05,920 --> 04:45:07,760
to these levels, you need to get this

9260
04:45:07,760 --> 04:45:09,360
first hire correct. Which brings me to

9261
04:45:09,360 --> 04:45:11,200
the AAA model itself and the opportunity

9262
04:45:11,200 --> 04:45:13,200
that this entire thing sits on and your

9263
04:45:13,200 --> 04:45:15,440
role and my role as as AAA owners. Um,

9264
04:45:15,440 --> 04:45:16,560
and the first thing you need to

9265
04:45:16,560 --> 04:45:17,920
understand is that there are a lot of

9266
04:45:17,920 --> 04:45:19,760
developers rushing to this promised AI

9267
04:45:19,760 --> 04:45:21,120
land with all the money so that they can

9268
04:45:21,120 --> 04:45:23,520
cash in on their on their share as we

9269
04:45:23,520 --> 04:45:24,718
are trying to cash in on our share.

9270
04:45:24,718 --> 04:45:26,320
They're trying to cash in on their share

9271
04:45:26,320 --> 04:45:28,160
um by running and upskilling to this to

9272
04:45:28,160 --> 04:45:29,680
this promised land, right? But of these

9273
04:45:29,680 --> 04:45:30,798
people that are rushing into the space

9274
04:45:30,798 --> 04:45:32,718
as developers, very few of them actually

9275
04:45:32,718 --> 04:45:34,480
have the skills and knowledge to create

9276
04:45:34,480 --> 04:45:35,840
value in the business with their skills

9277
04:45:35,840 --> 04:45:38,160
and and use this technology to actually

9278
04:45:38,160 --> 04:45:39,600
solve a real problem and create value,

9279
04:45:39,600 --> 04:45:41,600
which is where your job as an AI agency

9280
04:45:41,600 --> 04:45:43,360
owner comes in. And that's to identify

9281
04:45:43,360 --> 04:45:45,360
opportunities for value creation with AI

9282
04:45:45,360 --> 04:45:47,360
and deploy the team and the resources

9283
04:45:47,360 --> 04:45:48,958
required to deliver it. Kind of like a

9284
04:45:48,958 --> 04:45:51,040
general in the army. Um, you survey the

9285
04:45:51,040 --> 04:45:52,320
situation and then you deploy the

9286
04:45:52,320 --> 04:45:54,560
resources or troops to solve that

9287
04:45:54,560 --> 04:45:56,480
particular problem. So you are the brain

9288
04:45:56,480 --> 04:45:57,840
and they are the sword. And this is

9289
04:45:57,840 --> 04:45:59,600
where you create value as the AI

9290
04:45:59,600 --> 04:46:00,878
automation agency owner. So the first

9291
04:46:00,878 --> 04:46:01,920
thing you need to understand when you

9292
04:46:01,920 --> 04:46:03,440
are hiring developers is there's a

9293
04:46:03,440 --> 04:46:04,718
there's a whole lot of different types

9294
04:46:04,718 --> 04:46:06,718
of developers. Um it's not just one. And

9295
04:46:06,718 --> 04:46:08,320
so you need to understand where you're

9296
04:46:08,320 --> 04:46:10,000
you're targeting your hiring efforts so

9297
04:46:10,000 --> 04:46:11,360
that you can get what you need to to

9298
04:46:11,360 --> 04:46:12,878
grow your business. So there's front end

9299
04:46:12,878 --> 04:46:16,000
developers, backend, full stack, devops,

9300
04:46:16,000 --> 04:46:17,200
there's a lot of different types as you

9301
04:46:17,200 --> 04:46:18,958
can see in this diagram here. Um so we

9302
04:46:18,958 --> 04:46:20,718
need to know what we're looking for in

9303
04:46:20,718 --> 04:46:21,920
particular so that we can actually grow

9304
04:46:21,920 --> 04:46:23,760
our business. Um so I've got this little

9305
04:46:23,760 --> 04:46:25,520
diagram here of these engineerospheres

9306
04:46:25,520 --> 04:46:27,600
or the spheres of engineering um

9307
04:46:27,600 --> 04:46:29,280
different areas uh basically and we've

9308
04:46:29,280 --> 04:46:31,280
got no code developers which have their

9309
04:46:31,280 --> 04:46:32,638
own little thing going and they have had

9310
04:46:32,638 --> 04:46:34,080
for the past while using things like

9311
04:46:34,080 --> 04:46:36,878
zapia and make air table bubble etc. And

9312
04:46:36,878 --> 04:46:38,958
then we have the more traditional AI ML

9313
04:46:38,958 --> 04:46:40,958
developers who are traditional software

9314
04:46:40,958 --> 04:46:42,638
engineers that know how to use Python.

9315
04:46:42,638 --> 04:46:44,000
They've used things like PyTorch or

9316
04:46:44,000 --> 04:46:45,760
TensorFlow and more recently they've

9317
04:46:45,760 --> 04:46:47,600
been using things like Lchain to build

9318
04:46:47,600 --> 04:46:50,878
LLM based apps um with with Python. But

9319
04:46:50,878 --> 04:46:52,400
what we're looking for really is this

9320
04:46:52,400 --> 04:46:54,560
the sweet spot of AAA developers or AI

9321
04:46:54,560 --> 04:46:56,638
automation agency developers that

9322
04:46:56,638 --> 04:46:58,798
combine both of these worlds. Um both

9323
04:46:58,798 --> 04:47:00,878
the no code low cody stuff and the

9324
04:47:00,878 --> 04:47:03,440
traditional AI IML expertise and that's

9325
04:47:03,440 --> 04:47:05,280
where we get this middle area here. So,

9326
04:47:05,280 --> 04:47:06,798
using platforms like voice flow, which

9327
04:47:06,798 --> 04:47:08,958
is our go-to chatbot builder, relevance

9328
04:47:08,958 --> 04:47:10,480
AI, which is great for building AI

9329
04:47:10,480 --> 04:47:12,320
tools, um, and particularly connecting

9330
04:47:12,320 --> 04:47:14,400
them to your GBTs and and AI agents, and

9331
04:47:14,400 --> 04:47:16,000
then platforms like my own Agent, which

9332
04:47:16,000 --> 04:47:17,920
allows you to build chat GBT like

9333
04:47:17,920 --> 04:47:19,200
experiences for your clients, and then

9334
04:47:19,200 --> 04:47:21,200
some expertise in how to use language

9335
04:47:21,200 --> 04:47:22,560
models, prompt engineering, and things

9336
04:47:22,560 --> 04:47:24,080
like this. So, there's a sweet spot

9337
04:47:24,080 --> 04:47:25,520
where these two words overlap, and

9338
04:47:25,520 --> 04:47:26,798
that's ideally where we want to be

9339
04:47:26,798 --> 04:47:28,160
hiring. Not only are there different

9340
04:47:28,160 --> 04:47:29,600
spheres of engineering, though, there's

9341
04:47:29,600 --> 04:47:30,878
also levels to the game, and there's

9342
04:47:30,878 --> 04:47:32,480
levels of software engineers going from

9343
04:47:32,480 --> 04:47:34,878
entry level to senior. So you've got a

9344
04:47:34,878 --> 04:47:35,920
bunch of different factors when you're

9345
04:47:35,920 --> 04:47:37,040
thinking of hiring which you need to

9346
04:47:37,040 --> 04:47:38,320
understand before you go and start

9347
04:47:38,320 --> 04:47:39,680
offering money for these positions. So

9348
04:47:39,680 --> 04:47:40,958
with these things in mind, what are we

9349
04:47:40,958 --> 04:47:43,360
actually looking for in our first hire?

9350
04:47:43,360 --> 04:47:44,718
So going back to the question of why are

9351
04:47:44,718 --> 04:47:46,160
we hiring in the first place? We're

9352
04:47:46,160 --> 04:47:47,760
either hiring for a lack of technical

9353
04:47:47,760 --> 04:47:49,840
expertise that that we are missing. And

9354
04:47:49,840 --> 04:47:51,360
you need help to be able to plan and

9355
04:47:51,360 --> 04:47:52,958
deliver the solutions because without

9356
04:47:52,958 --> 04:47:54,480
this expertise, there's no there's no

9357
04:47:54,480 --> 04:47:56,000
knowledge gap within your agency between

9358
04:47:56,000 --> 04:47:57,520
you and and the person that you're

9359
04:47:57,520 --> 04:47:58,638
you're trying to help, right? you need

9360
04:47:58,638 --> 04:48:00,400
some kind of expertise and you're you're

9361
04:48:00,400 --> 04:48:01,680
making money by bridging that knowledge

9362
04:48:01,680 --> 04:48:03,040
gap for them and delivering solutions

9363
04:48:03,040 --> 04:48:03,920
that they wouldn't be able to do

9364
04:48:03,920 --> 04:48:05,440
themselves. So you may need some

9365
04:48:05,440 --> 04:48:07,120
technical expertise in the business or

9366
04:48:07,120 --> 04:48:09,040
it may just be a lack of time where you

9367
04:48:09,040 --> 04:48:10,798
need to delegate project delivery to

9368
04:48:10,798 --> 04:48:12,160
allow you to focus on growing the

9369
04:48:12,160 --> 04:48:14,400
business um eg by making content like I

9370
04:48:14,400 --> 04:48:17,440
do on YouTube taking sales calls etc. So

9371
04:48:17,440 --> 04:48:18,718
it's either one of these two problems

9372
04:48:18,718 --> 04:48:20,480
and based on your situation whether it's

9373
04:48:20,480 --> 04:48:22,320
a lack of technical expertise or just a

9374
04:48:22,320 --> 04:48:24,320
lack of time um that determines whether

9375
04:48:24,320 --> 04:48:26,240
you're trying to hire a senior developer

9376
04:48:26,240 --> 04:48:28,080
or a junior developer. So seniors are

9377
04:48:28,080 --> 04:48:29,760
able to lead a team. They're able to

9378
04:48:29,760 --> 04:48:31,360
lead and manage communications with your

9379
04:48:31,360 --> 04:48:33,120
clients. Uh they're able to architect

9380
04:48:33,120 --> 04:48:34,718
and plan solutions. They're able to

9381
04:48:34,718 --> 04:48:36,878
innovate and lead product improvement.

9382
04:48:36,878 --> 04:48:38,400
They're able to solve problems when they

9383
04:48:38,400 --> 04:48:40,320
occur. And finally, they're also able to

9384
04:48:40,320 --> 04:48:42,400
just be used to uh build and deliver the

9385
04:48:42,400 --> 04:48:43,280
projects that you say you're going to

9386
04:48:43,280 --> 04:48:44,798
do. And senior developers like this are

9387
04:48:44,798 --> 04:48:46,638
contrasted against junior developers,

9388
04:48:46,638 --> 04:48:48,000
which are basically just good for

9389
04:48:48,000 --> 04:48:50,000
building and delivering projects or

9390
04:48:50,000 --> 04:48:51,520
updating clients on what's happening. So

9391
04:48:51,520 --> 04:48:52,878
they can't really lead communications.

9392
04:48:52,878 --> 04:48:54,160
You wouldn't want them hopping on calls

9393
04:48:54,160 --> 04:48:55,760
one-on-one with the client and sorting

9394
04:48:55,760 --> 04:48:57,280
them out there. That's where the senior

9395
04:48:57,280 --> 04:48:58,480
guys come in and they have to be able to

9396
04:48:58,480 --> 04:49:00,638
manage a team, lead the project, etc.

9397
04:49:00,638 --> 04:49:01,920
And you can really hand things off to

9398
04:49:01,920 --> 04:49:03,920
them. So to illustrate when you need one

9399
04:49:03,920 --> 04:49:05,360
or the other, uh we've got some

9400
04:49:05,360 --> 04:49:07,120
scenarios here. So scenario one is a

9401
04:49:07,120 --> 04:49:09,040
technical AAA founder. Say you've got

9402
04:49:09,040 --> 04:49:10,320
some background in software engineering

9403
04:49:10,320 --> 04:49:11,680
yourself. Uh that means you're

9404
04:49:11,680 --> 04:49:12,958
comfortable in planning the solutions

9405
04:49:12,958 --> 04:49:14,560
and leading the development. So you you

9406
04:49:14,560 --> 04:49:16,798
act as a senior developer, but you hire

9407
04:49:16,798 --> 04:49:19,440
one or two juniors below you that you

9408
04:49:19,440 --> 04:49:21,280
can kind of delegate to and rotate them

9409
04:49:21,280 --> 04:49:22,878
as they're available. Um so you can

9410
04:49:22,878 --> 04:49:24,798
delegate the actual delivery of it and

9411
04:49:24,798 --> 04:49:25,920
manage the client communication

9412
04:49:25,920 --> 04:49:27,440
yourself. In this case you're serving as

9413
04:49:27,440 --> 04:49:29,600
the CTO or the lead developer of the

9414
04:49:29,600 --> 04:49:31,200
organization and this is quite common

9415
04:49:31,200 --> 04:49:32,320
for the people who are tech

9416
04:49:32,320 --> 04:49:33,840
professionals who join my program my

9417
04:49:33,840 --> 04:49:35,520
accelerator. Um and they come in and

9418
04:49:35,520 --> 04:49:37,120
they say hey I want to I have the

9419
04:49:37,120 --> 04:49:38,400
capabilities and the expertise to be

9420
04:49:38,400 --> 04:49:40,080
able to lead the team myself and that

9421
04:49:40,080 --> 04:49:41,280
allows you to run a little bit leaner

9422
04:49:41,280 --> 04:49:42,560
because as you'll see in a little bit

9423
04:49:42,560 --> 04:49:44,000
the pricing of developers of course

9424
04:49:44,000 --> 04:49:45,280
juniors are going to be cheaper. So, if

9425
04:49:45,280 --> 04:49:46,958
you do have the skills and you want to

9426
04:49:46,958 --> 04:49:49,280
start an agency like this, you can serve

9427
04:49:49,280 --> 04:49:51,440
as the the lead developer, the CTO, and

9428
04:49:51,440 --> 04:49:52,798
just hire some juniors underneath you.

9429
04:49:52,798 --> 04:49:54,480
And a good example of this is Mark, a

9430
04:49:54,480 --> 04:49:55,680
member from my community. And and I've

9431
04:49:55,680 --> 04:49:56,958
actually got a podcast here with him on

9432
04:49:56,958 --> 04:49:57,920
my channel. If you haven't watched that

9433
04:49:57,920 --> 04:49:59,040
already, I I'll leave that link down

9434
04:49:59,040 --> 04:50:01,040
below. But Mark is a is a software

9435
04:50:01,040 --> 04:50:02,638
engineer by trade. He came into the

9436
04:50:02,638 --> 04:50:04,480
program and he's now done over $50,000

9437
04:50:04,480 --> 04:50:06,240
with his with his AR business, but he's

9438
04:50:06,240 --> 04:50:08,000
serving as the lead developer and he has

9439
04:50:08,000 --> 04:50:09,360
a team of juniors underneath them. So,

9440
04:50:09,360 --> 04:50:11,760
that's one way of doing it. Um, but

9441
04:50:11,760 --> 04:50:13,520
secondly, if you're a nontechnical AAA

9442
04:50:13,520 --> 04:50:15,120
founder and and some of you, I know

9443
04:50:15,120 --> 04:50:16,400
you're coming into this opportunity and

9444
04:50:16,400 --> 04:50:17,520
you don't have a software background,

9445
04:50:17,520 --> 04:50:18,878
which is completely fine, but it's a

9446
04:50:18,878 --> 04:50:19,840
little bit different to how you would

9447
04:50:19,840 --> 04:50:21,200
approach it as someone with that

9448
04:50:21,200 --> 04:50:22,400
background. In this case, you'd have a

9449
04:50:22,400 --> 04:50:24,240
nontechnical founder who understands the

9450
04:50:24,240 --> 04:50:25,360
problems that the clients are facing,

9451
04:50:25,360 --> 04:50:26,958
but lacks the depth of knowledge

9452
04:50:26,958 --> 04:50:28,320
required to actually plan how you're

9453
04:50:28,320 --> 04:50:29,920
going to deliver that. So in this case,

9454
04:50:29,920 --> 04:50:32,320
you would hire one senior AAA developer

9455
04:50:32,320 --> 04:50:34,958
and then the owner can work alongside

9456
04:50:34,958 --> 04:50:36,560
the dev and the client to make sure that

9457
04:50:36,560 --> 04:50:38,320
the expectations are aligned and then

9458
04:50:38,320 --> 04:50:39,680
they can delegate the delivery and

9459
04:50:39,680 --> 04:50:41,280
communication to that senior developer

9460
04:50:41,280 --> 04:50:43,040
cuz as we said these seniors can

9461
04:50:43,040 --> 04:50:44,160
actually lead and manage the

9462
04:50:44,160 --> 04:50:45,760
communication with the client and also

9463
04:50:45,760 --> 04:50:47,280
deliver the products themselves. So in

9464
04:50:47,280 --> 04:50:48,480
this case, you hop on sales calls with

9465
04:50:48,480 --> 04:50:49,760
the client. You bring them in, you

9466
04:50:49,760 --> 04:50:50,878
connect them with your developer, you

9467
04:50:50,878 --> 04:50:52,080
make sure that everything's all good,

9468
04:50:52,080 --> 04:50:53,760
and you allow them to manage the

9469
04:50:53,760 --> 04:50:55,280
delivery of those services. And this

9470
04:50:55,280 --> 04:50:57,360
gives you more time to bring more

9471
04:50:57,360 --> 04:50:58,798
business into the business. And a great

9472
04:50:58,798 --> 04:50:59,920
example of this in action is my

9473
04:50:59,920 --> 04:51:02,080
co-founder Josh at Morningside. He came

9474
04:51:02,080 --> 04:51:03,760
in completely clueless when it came to

9475
04:51:03,760 --> 04:51:06,080
software and building AI solutions. It

9476
04:51:06,080 --> 04:51:07,760
was just completely foreign to him. But

9477
04:51:07,760 --> 04:51:09,360
in the space of about 2 months of being

9478
04:51:09,360 --> 04:51:11,200
on sales calls with me, he was able to

9479
04:51:11,200 --> 04:51:12,480
learn, okay, these are the questions you

9480
04:51:12,480 --> 04:51:14,000
ask. This the kind of solutions that we

9481
04:51:14,000 --> 04:51:15,920
offer. Okay. Okay. And then I was able

9482
04:51:15,920 --> 04:51:17,760
to fully hand off sales to him and then

9483
04:51:17,760 --> 04:51:19,280
he's able to get on these, hop on a

9484
04:51:19,280 --> 04:51:20,480
course with our developers, connect them

9485
04:51:20,480 --> 04:51:21,680
up and do the process that I've just

9486
04:51:21,680 --> 04:51:23,200
gone through here. So, it is possible.

9487
04:51:23,200 --> 04:51:24,878
And Josh to this day still does not know

9488
04:51:24,878 --> 04:51:26,480
how to code, but he leads all of our

9489
04:51:26,480 --> 04:51:27,760
sales and all of our operations at

9490
04:51:27,760 --> 04:51:29,200
Morningside. So, it is definitely

9491
04:51:29,200 --> 04:51:30,638
possible. And don't let your

9492
04:51:30,638 --> 04:51:32,080
self-limiting belief stop you from

9493
04:51:32,080 --> 04:51:33,600
achieving something like myself and Josh

9494
04:51:33,600 --> 04:51:35,040
have. Your next question might be, okay,

9495
04:51:35,040 --> 04:51:36,480
how much does this cost for a senior

9496
04:51:36,480 --> 04:51:38,080
developer or a junior developer? I know

9497
04:51:38,080 --> 04:51:39,600
what I need now, but how much am I how

9498
04:51:39,600 --> 04:51:41,520
much am I on the line for here? So, um,

9499
04:51:41,520 --> 04:51:43,200
there's three tiers of AR talent that

9500
04:51:43,200 --> 04:51:44,958
we've seen and and we've hired at

9501
04:51:44,958 --> 04:51:46,798
Morningside, and let me just tell you

9502
04:51:46,798 --> 04:51:48,400
right now that you don't want to be

9503
04:51:48,400 --> 04:51:50,000
dealing with the low low tier talent

9504
04:51:50,000 --> 04:51:51,200
there. So, just take that off the menu

9505
04:51:51,200 --> 04:51:52,878
completely. For less than $30, they're

9506
04:51:52,878 --> 04:51:54,878
likely low tier talent and not something

9507
04:51:54,878 --> 04:51:56,240
that you want to get involved with. I

9508
04:51:56,240 --> 04:51:58,040
mean, at your own

9509
04:51:58,040 --> 04:52:00,638
risk, you can you can ignore me if you

9510
04:52:00,638 --> 04:52:02,000
want, but this is from my experience

9511
04:52:02,000 --> 04:52:03,040
that you don't want to be touching

9512
04:52:03,040 --> 04:52:05,440
anything. You get what you pay for um if

9513
04:52:05,440 --> 04:52:06,718
you're good on the vetting side. And

9514
04:52:06,718 --> 04:52:08,240
these tiers of talent translate nicely

9515
04:52:08,240 --> 04:52:10,160
into these price brackets for senior and

9516
04:52:10,160 --> 04:52:11,840
junior developers. So the senior

9517
04:52:11,840 --> 04:52:13,120
developers, they're likely going to be

9518
04:52:13,120 --> 04:52:15,440
$70 to $100 per hour. Ideally, they've

9519
04:52:15,440 --> 04:52:17,280
got some kind of traditional development

9520
04:52:17,280 --> 04:52:18,560
background because they are going to be

9521
04:52:18,560 --> 04:52:19,760
leading the team and you are trying to

9522
04:52:19,760 --> 04:52:21,040
bring in if you're going to be buying

9523
04:52:21,040 --> 04:52:22,560
and bringing in expertise. You don't

9524
04:52:22,560 --> 04:52:24,718
just want to bring in a sliver of hey,

9525
04:52:24,718 --> 04:52:26,240
he can build chat bots on voice flow.

9526
04:52:26,240 --> 04:52:27,200
You kind of want to get the whole

9527
04:52:27,200 --> 04:52:29,360
picture because um you probably don't as

9528
04:52:29,360 --> 04:52:31,680
the agency owner have much uh expertise.

9529
04:52:31,680 --> 04:52:32,958
You want them to compliment you, cover

9530
04:52:32,958 --> 04:52:34,160
off the areas that you're not familiar

9531
04:52:34,160 --> 04:52:36,000
with, um, and understand what production

9532
04:52:36,000 --> 04:52:37,600
applications look like, not just

9533
04:52:37,600 --> 04:52:39,440
gimmicky little chat bots and stuff like

9534
04:52:39,440 --> 04:52:41,280
you probably can do yourself. There's a

9535
04:52:41,280 --> 04:52:43,520
big difference between tinkering around

9536
04:52:43,520 --> 04:52:45,200
with a prototype and a production grade

9537
04:52:45,200 --> 04:52:46,638
solution. So these guys that you bring

9538
04:52:46,638 --> 04:52:48,480
in as a senior need to cover off that

9539
04:52:48,480 --> 04:52:49,840
area for you within the business. So a

9540
04:52:49,840 --> 04:52:51,440
traditional developer turned AI solution

9541
04:52:51,440 --> 04:52:53,520
specialist where they understand voice

9542
04:52:53,520 --> 04:52:55,040
flow, agentive, all these different

9543
04:52:55,040 --> 04:52:57,120
platforms, relevance, make, etc.

9544
04:52:57,120 --> 04:52:59,120
Ideally, you can get that hybrid. um

9545
04:52:59,120 --> 04:53:00,160
you're not always going to be able to

9546
04:53:00,160 --> 04:53:02,160
find it, but the hybrid senior developer

9547
04:53:02,160 --> 04:53:03,280
who could do both sides of that is

9548
04:53:03,280 --> 04:53:04,240
really what you're looking for. And

9549
04:53:04,240 --> 04:53:05,840
ideally 5 years of experience in a

9550
04:53:05,840 --> 04:53:07,840
development role. And then you have the

9551
04:53:07,840 --> 04:53:09,840
juniors and we split these up into two

9552
04:53:09,840 --> 04:53:11,680
categories really. U guys who can do the

9553
04:53:11,680 --> 04:53:14,080
only AAA related services. So whether

9554
04:53:14,080 --> 04:53:16,000
that's voice flow, relevance, etc. Only

9555
04:53:16,000 --> 04:53:18,080
the low code, no cody stuff. Uh they're

9556
04:53:18,080 --> 04:53:19,840
only worth about $30 to $40 an hour from

9557
04:53:19,840 --> 04:53:22,080
from our testing. Uh but if they have

9558
04:53:22,080 --> 04:53:23,360
the traditional background and they're

9559
04:53:23,360 --> 04:53:25,280
able to combine it with the AAA

9560
04:53:25,280 --> 04:53:26,560
solutions that we typically sell and

9561
04:53:26,560 --> 04:53:27,840
they understand everything that I talk

9562
04:53:27,840 --> 04:53:29,200
about here on the channel, then they're

9563
04:53:29,200 --> 04:53:31,600
worth more like uh $50 to $70 per hour.

9564
04:53:31,600 --> 04:53:34,080
And the reason for this is that if a

9565
04:53:34,080 --> 04:53:36,000
developer can also leverage these no

9566
04:53:36,000 --> 04:53:38,160
code, low code tools at the right time,

9567
04:53:38,160 --> 04:53:40,718
you can deliver services with far less

9568
04:53:40,718 --> 04:53:42,240
time invested. So, for example, if you

9569
04:53:42,240 --> 04:53:43,840
wanted to build a web chat widget

9570
04:53:43,840 --> 04:53:45,440
chatbot and put it on a customer's

9571
04:53:45,440 --> 04:53:47,200
website, um, and you tried to do that

9572
04:53:47,200 --> 04:53:49,200
all custom, it would take a ton of time

9573
04:53:49,200 --> 04:53:51,040
and cost you a lot more than if you had

9574
04:53:51,040 --> 04:53:53,440
a guy who knew how to use uh, these AAA

9575
04:53:53,440 --> 04:53:54,718
platforms that we talk about so often

9576
04:53:54,718 --> 04:53:56,878
here on the channel and was able to just

9577
04:53:56,878 --> 04:53:58,320
go, okay, I can put this on voice floor.

9578
04:53:58,320 --> 04:53:59,360
I can build this out in a couple of

9579
04:53:59,360 --> 04:54:00,560
hours. You're actually getting more

9580
04:54:00,560 --> 04:54:01,760
value out of them because they're able

9581
04:54:01,760 --> 04:54:03,760
to deliver the same thing for less and

9582
04:54:03,760 --> 04:54:06,000
less time. So you paying $50 to $70 per

9583
04:54:06,000 --> 04:54:07,680
hour if they're able to at the right

9584
04:54:07,680 --> 04:54:09,360
time use low code and no code tools

9585
04:54:09,360 --> 04:54:10,798
combined with their traditional

9586
04:54:10,798 --> 04:54:12,240
background, you're getting more bang for

9587
04:54:12,240 --> 04:54:13,440
your buck, hence them being more

9588
04:54:13,440 --> 04:54:14,560
expensive. And these guys here, the

9589
04:54:14,560 --> 04:54:16,560
juniors who have traditional and AAA

9590
04:54:16,560 --> 04:54:17,920
experience and knowledge, they're

9591
04:54:17,920 --> 04:54:20,080
essentially a a baby version of the

9592
04:54:20,080 --> 04:54:21,200
senior, right? They're just missing the

9593
04:54:21,200 --> 04:54:23,920
managerial capabilities um and the the

9594
04:54:23,920 --> 04:54:24,958
ability to actually plan these

9595
04:54:24,958 --> 04:54:26,878
solutions. So these guys are highly

9596
04:54:26,878 --> 04:54:28,400
valuable and can be trained up as you'll

9597
04:54:28,400 --> 04:54:30,958
see just here. You can turn your junior

9598
04:54:30,958 --> 04:54:32,878
developers into senior over time. Um, so

9599
04:54:32,878 --> 04:54:33,920
they are the talent that you're looking

9600
04:54:33,920 --> 04:54:35,520
to develop and this requires zooming out

9601
04:54:35,520 --> 04:54:37,120
a lot more in your agency and and not

9602
04:54:37,120 --> 04:54:38,798
seeing them as a static part of your

9603
04:54:38,798 --> 04:54:40,240
business, but seeing talent as a major

9604
04:54:40,240 --> 04:54:41,440
part of how you're going to grow over

9605
04:54:41,440 --> 04:54:42,958
time. Um, and picking the right things

9606
04:54:42,958 --> 04:54:44,878
and planting seeds and and watching them

9607
04:54:44,878 --> 04:54:46,638
grow over time is really important. So

9608
04:54:46,638 --> 04:54:47,840
when it comes to your senior developers,

9609
04:54:47,840 --> 04:54:49,520
you need the strong technical skills, of

9610
04:54:49,520 --> 04:54:51,440
course, the 5 years of experience, deep

9611
04:54:51,440 --> 04:54:52,958
understanding of traditional code, um,

9612
04:54:52,958 --> 04:54:55,120
and also ideally some of the newer stuff

9613
04:54:55,120 --> 04:54:56,718
that we talk about on this channel. uh

9614
04:54:56,718 --> 04:54:58,000
interpersonal skills, being able to talk

9615
04:54:58,000 --> 04:54:59,200
to your clients, being able to deal with

9616
04:54:59,200 --> 04:55:00,718
the team, uh being able to communicate

9617
04:55:00,718 --> 04:55:02,080
with you about what the hell's going on

9618
04:55:02,080 --> 04:55:04,080
in the business, which is so key. Um and

9619
04:55:04,080 --> 04:55:05,520
the ability to mentor and coach your

9620
04:55:05,520 --> 04:55:06,958
juniors, which is really important. And

9621
04:55:06,958 --> 04:55:08,400
for juniors, you just want to pick rock

9622
04:55:08,400 --> 04:55:11,360
stars that are just starting off. They

9623
04:55:11,360 --> 04:55:12,958
natural aptitude towards the the stuff

9624
04:55:12,958 --> 04:55:14,798
that you're building, potential, and the

9625
04:55:14,798 --> 04:55:16,878
ability to learn as well. So, juniors,

9626
04:55:16,878 --> 04:55:18,798
they're not by definition, they're not

9627
04:55:18,798 --> 04:55:21,040
garbage or or not useful. They're just

9628
04:55:21,040 --> 04:55:22,160
people who are earlier in the journey

9629
04:55:22,160 --> 04:55:23,680
and you can with the right training and

9630
04:55:23,680 --> 04:55:25,280
with the right senior developer can

9631
04:55:25,280 --> 04:55:26,798
really bring them up into a super high

9632
04:55:26,798 --> 04:55:28,320
valuable part of the organization. And

9633
04:55:28,320 --> 04:55:30,160
just quickly I want to introduce a few

9634
04:55:30,160 --> 04:55:31,760
uh considerations when you are hiring

9635
04:55:31,760 --> 04:55:33,440
and that's the type of agency that

9636
04:55:33,440 --> 04:55:34,958
you're running will determine the type

9637
04:55:34,958 --> 04:55:36,718
of developer that you need to hire. Um

9638
04:55:36,718 --> 04:55:37,920
so whether you're doing a niche or

9639
04:55:37,920 --> 04:55:39,360
general agency because there's a big

9640
04:55:39,360 --> 04:55:40,718
difference in picking that picking the

9641
04:55:40,718 --> 04:55:42,240
right type is so key to your success in

9642
04:55:42,240 --> 04:55:44,080
the space. So uh basically are you

9643
04:55:44,080 --> 04:55:45,760
building from scratch every time or are

9644
04:55:45,760 --> 04:55:47,600
you using templated solutions? So, if

9645
04:55:47,600 --> 04:55:49,040
you're general agency, you're likely

9646
04:55:49,040 --> 04:55:50,798
going to be doing custom every time. And

9647
04:55:50,798 --> 04:55:52,480
if you're a a niche agency, you're

9648
04:55:52,480 --> 04:55:54,400
likely going to be replacing or or copy

9649
04:55:54,400 --> 04:55:56,320
and pasting across multiple clients a

9650
04:55:56,320 --> 04:55:57,760
considerable amount of the build. And

9651
04:55:57,760 --> 04:55:59,680
that determines the level or skill level

9652
04:55:59,680 --> 04:56:01,040
of developers that you need. As you'll

9653
04:56:01,040 --> 04:56:02,958
see in a second, reusability is a key

9654
04:56:02,958 --> 04:56:04,320
concept that you need to understand. And

9655
04:56:04,320 --> 04:56:05,600
secondly, are you just selling low code

9656
04:56:05,600 --> 04:56:07,520
or no code solutions or are you also

9657
04:56:07,520 --> 04:56:08,958
throwing in some customcoded aspect to

9658
04:56:08,958 --> 04:56:10,560
it as well. So, do they need that

9659
04:56:10,560 --> 04:56:12,000
traditional background? And these are

9660
04:56:12,000 --> 04:56:13,920
things you need to keep in mind.

9661
04:56:13,920 --> 04:56:15,680
usability. As I said, um, planning and

9662
04:56:15,680 --> 04:56:17,280
building from scratch is difficult and

9663
04:56:17,280 --> 04:56:19,200
prone to more errors. The fact that you

9664
04:56:19,200 --> 04:56:21,120
can copy and paste across clients if

9665
04:56:21,120 --> 04:56:23,520
you're running each agency allows you to

9666
04:56:23,520 --> 04:56:25,360
minimize the amount of brain power

9667
04:56:25,360 --> 04:56:26,798
required to think like actually planning

9668
04:56:26,798 --> 04:56:28,958
and architecting a solution is difficult

9669
04:56:28,958 --> 04:56:31,040
to do every single time something new

9670
04:56:31,040 --> 04:56:32,958
comes in the door. Smart developers can

9671
04:56:32,958 --> 04:56:34,320
handle these errors. That's why you hire

9672
04:56:34,320 --> 04:56:36,958
the senior because they can solve. Um,

9673
04:56:36,958 --> 04:56:38,320
but if they're just modifying from a

9674
04:56:38,320 --> 04:56:40,400
template and you're a niche agency, um,

9675
04:56:40,400 --> 04:56:42,480
then lower tier developers will do and

9676
04:56:42,480 --> 04:56:44,160
will suffice in most cases because

9677
04:56:44,160 --> 04:56:45,680
they're not having to rethink or

9678
04:56:45,680 --> 04:56:47,120
reinvent the wheel every time they do a

9679
04:56:47,120 --> 04:56:48,798
new project. Therefore, you don't need

9680
04:56:48,798 --> 04:56:50,878
uh as expensive or as intelligent or or

9681
04:56:50,878 --> 04:56:52,400
skilled developers. Now, the key

9682
04:56:52,400 --> 04:56:53,520
question, you know what kind of

9683
04:56:53,520 --> 04:56:54,798
developer you need, you know what level

9684
04:56:54,798 --> 04:56:55,760
you're looking for, you know what's

9685
04:56:55,760 --> 04:56:57,840
missing in your business. Um, where the

9686
04:56:57,840 --> 04:56:59,040
hell do you find them? Which is a

9687
04:56:59,040 --> 04:57:00,718
question that I get a lot. And I just

9688
04:57:00,718 --> 04:57:01,680
want to remind you quickly of these

9689
04:57:01,680 --> 04:57:03,360
engineer spheres where we've got no code

9690
04:57:03,360 --> 04:57:04,958
developers, these traditional guys on

9691
04:57:04,958 --> 04:57:06,638
the right and then the AAA developers

9692
04:57:06,638 --> 04:57:08,000
which are kind of this hybrid in between

9693
04:57:08,000 --> 04:57:09,200
where they haven't been watching my

9694
04:57:09,200 --> 04:57:11,040
content introduced to the the concept of

9695
04:57:11,040 --> 04:57:12,638
this AI automation agency model as a

9696
04:57:12,638 --> 04:57:14,718
whole and they understand okay chat bots

9697
04:57:14,718 --> 04:57:17,280
and automations okay tools etc. This is

9698
04:57:17,280 --> 04:57:18,320
the kind of stuff that we're delivering

9699
04:57:18,320 --> 04:57:20,080
on and these are the tools that we and

9700
04:57:20,080 --> 04:57:21,520
platforms that we use to deliver them.

9701
04:57:21,520 --> 04:57:22,958
So you need to find people who fall into

9702
04:57:22,958 --> 04:57:24,958
this AAA developer category so that you

9703
04:57:24,958 --> 04:57:26,718
don't have to bring them up to speed on

9704
04:57:26,718 --> 04:57:28,240
all of this information about this is

9705
04:57:28,240 --> 04:57:29,680
the model that I'm running. These are

9706
04:57:29,680 --> 04:57:31,120
the tools that we use. These are the

9707
04:57:31,120 --> 04:57:32,320
kind of things we sell. You need to find

9708
04:57:32,320 --> 04:57:33,360
them ideally where they already

9709
04:57:33,360 --> 04:57:34,400
understand that and they've already

9710
04:57:34,400 --> 04:57:35,600
built with the tools that we need to

9711
04:57:35,600 --> 04:57:36,718
build with. And the best place to find

9712
04:57:36,718 --> 04:57:38,798
these AAA developers is in my free

9713
04:57:38,798 --> 04:57:40,958
school community. Not to just shameless

9714
04:57:40,958 --> 04:57:42,958
plug here, but we do have nearly 15,000

9715
04:57:42,958 --> 04:57:44,718
people who have watched my videos,

9716
04:57:44,718 --> 04:57:47,120
understand this, and a huge portion of

9717
04:57:47,120 --> 04:57:48,718
the community members in here are

9718
04:57:48,718 --> 04:57:49,920
developers and do have a development

9719
04:57:49,920 --> 04:57:51,920
background. I've heard of people hiring

9720
04:57:51,920 --> 04:57:54,160
ex postman head of engineering and now

9721
04:57:54,160 --> 04:57:55,440
they have an incredible partner within

9722
04:57:55,440 --> 04:57:57,200
their agency. There is incredible talent

9723
04:57:57,200 --> 04:57:58,958
that floats through and watches my

9724
04:57:58,958 --> 04:58:00,718
videos and floats through my community

9725
04:58:00,718 --> 04:58:01,840
looking for people and looking for

9726
04:58:01,840 --> 04:58:03,040
opportunities. There's so many people

9727
04:58:03,040 --> 04:58:04,400
coming out of big tech at the moment who

9728
04:58:04,400 --> 04:58:06,480
are looking to get into this AI space

9729
04:58:06,480 --> 04:58:08,798
and the AI agency model is such a a good

9730
04:58:08,798 --> 04:58:10,240
thing for people to get into because if

9731
04:58:10,240 --> 04:58:11,520
you're developer, you can come in and

9732
04:58:11,520 --> 04:58:13,280
give give value and maybe partner on the

9733
04:58:13,280 --> 04:58:15,040
agency. If you're a sales guy, you're a

9734
04:58:15,040 --> 04:58:16,560
you're you're an entrepreneur, you can

9735
04:58:16,560 --> 04:58:18,638
come in and lead the agency and and

9736
04:58:18,638 --> 04:58:20,160
identify problems to solve with AI. It's

9737
04:58:20,160 --> 04:58:21,760
it's so exciting for so many people

9738
04:58:21,760 --> 04:58:23,040
which is why we have so many people

9739
04:58:23,040 --> 04:58:25,200

9748
04:58:38,480 --> 04:58:40,240

9749
04:58:40,240 --> 04:58:41,760
of hiring going on in the community

9751
04:58:42,878 --> 04:58:44,480
posts is getting like five to 10

9752
04:58:44,480 --> 04:58:46,480
different responses on it so I urge you

9753
04:58:46,480 --> 04:58:47,920
guys if you're looking to hire join the

9754
04:58:47,920 --> 04:58:49,200
free community it's down below first

9755
04:58:49,200 --> 04:58:50,878
link in the descript description, make a

9756
04:58:50,878 --> 04:58:52,798
post, pitch yourself, say, "This is what

9757
04:58:52,798 --> 04:58:54,560
my agency is. This is what we're doing,

9758
04:58:54,560 --> 04:58:56,320
and be really and and you do need to

9759
04:58:56,320 --> 04:58:57,600
sell yourself in order to attract the

9760
04:58:57,600 --> 04:58:59,120
best talent." So, get in there, drop a

9761
04:58:59,120 --> 04:59:00,480
post, and also, if you're a developer

9762
04:59:00,480 --> 04:59:01,520
watching this, get in there and start

9763
04:59:01,520 --> 04:59:03,440
replying. Um, engage in the community.

9764
04:59:03,440 --> 04:59:05,200
And there's so much value to be creative

9765
04:59:05,200 --> 04:59:06,958
by connecting the right people together.

9766
04:59:06,958 --> 04:59:08,240
And that's what I want for most of you

9767
04:59:08,240 --> 04:59:09,920
is that if you can't get this right, if

9768
04:59:09,920 --> 04:59:11,680
you can't find someone to hire, um, or

9769
04:59:11,680 --> 04:59:13,600
you can't pair up a a sales guy, an ops

9770
04:59:13,600 --> 04:59:15,840
guy, and a a developer, then you're

9771
04:59:15,840 --> 04:59:17,120
likely never going to succeed longterm

9772
04:59:17,120 --> 04:59:18,638
with this business cuz it's so crucial.

9773
04:59:18,638 --> 04:59:19,760
something that I found and I've seen

9774
04:59:19,760 --> 04:59:21,040
time and time again with people in my

9775
04:59:21,040 --> 04:59:22,160
free and paid communities. So once

9776
04:59:22,160 --> 04:59:23,360
you've got into my school and posted,

9777
04:59:23,360 --> 04:59:24,878
hey, I'm looking for a junior developer

9778
04:59:24,878 --> 04:59:26,480
who knows this, this, this, familiar

9779
04:59:26,480 --> 04:59:27,840
with these tools, we looking to sell

9780
04:59:27,840 --> 04:59:29,920
these, etc. Um, then you need to know

9781
04:59:29,920 --> 04:59:31,680
how to sign and what deal to actually

9782
04:59:31,680 --> 04:59:33,280
close these guys on, close these guys

9783
04:59:33,280 --> 04:59:34,798
on, but what contract are you bringing

9784
04:59:34,798 --> 04:59:35,920
them into your business on? How are you

9785
04:59:35,920 --> 04:59:36,878
going to be interacting with them?

9786
04:59:36,878 --> 04:59:38,480
What's the compensation structure? Um,

9787
04:59:38,480 --> 04:59:39,840
which is a really big question I get as

9788
04:59:39,840 --> 04:59:41,680
well. So, uh, the contract progression

9789
04:59:41,680 --> 04:59:43,280
that I recommend and that we've used at

9790
04:59:43,280 --> 04:59:44,958
Morningside is is starting off with a

9791
04:59:44,958 --> 04:59:46,480
fixed contract. Then we don't do it

9792
04:59:46,480 --> 04:59:48,240
anymore. But when we very first started

9793
04:59:48,240 --> 04:59:50,160
our agency, we were doing it on a fixed

9794
04:59:50,160 --> 04:59:51,920
contract where we'd go to have

9795
04:59:51,920 --> 04:59:53,360
conversations with a bunch of developers

9796
04:59:53,360 --> 04:59:55,440
and and AI specialists at the time who

9797
04:59:55,440 --> 04:59:57,520
really weren't much specialist at all,

9798
04:59:57,520 --> 04:59:59,280
but we'd go to them and say, "Hey, we

9799
04:59:59,280 --> 05:00:00,958
have a client here who needs XYZ

9800
05:00:00,958 --> 05:00:02,560
services. Can you give us a proposal on

9801
05:00:02,560 --> 05:00:03,840
how much time this would take and how

9802
05:00:03,840 --> 05:00:05,040
much it would cost you?" We'd get

9803
05:00:05,040 --> 05:00:06,080
proposals back from our different

9804
05:00:06,080 --> 05:00:08,320
developers, mark it up 2 or 3x, go to

9805
05:00:08,320 --> 05:00:09,520
our client and say, "Hey, this is the

9806
05:00:09,520 --> 05:00:11,440
price of the build." Very easy way to

9807
05:00:11,440 --> 05:00:12,718
get started. you're not necessarily

9808
05:00:12,718 --> 05:00:14,160
putting cash up front because the

9809
05:00:14,160 --> 05:00:15,520
client's then going to pay that invoice

9810
05:00:15,520 --> 05:00:17,280
or pay half the invoice and you can pass

9811
05:00:17,280 --> 05:00:18,400
it to the developer. So, as long as you

9812
05:00:18,400 --> 05:00:19,760
got a margin there, you can basically

9813
05:00:19,760 --> 05:00:21,280
never lose money as long as a project

9814
05:00:21,280 --> 05:00:22,400
goes through without issue. And then

9815
05:00:22,400 --> 05:00:23,520
after that, if they've shown that

9816
05:00:23,520 --> 05:00:24,480
they're good and they know what they're

9817
05:00:24,480 --> 05:00:26,000
doing, you can move them onto an hourly

9818
05:00:26,000 --> 05:00:27,600
contract and give them a starting wage.

9819
05:00:27,600 --> 05:00:29,760
Say, "Hey, look, we agree on $30, $40

9820
05:00:29,760 --> 05:00:31,440
per hour. We're going to do a 30-day

9821
05:00:31,440 --> 05:00:32,638
free trial." So, you can basically cut

9822
05:00:32,638 --> 05:00:34,480
them off at any point. Um, I mean, you

9823
05:00:34,480 --> 05:00:35,840
can put in the contract that you can end

9824
05:00:35,840 --> 05:00:37,760
it at any point. Um, so this trial

9825
05:00:37,760 --> 05:00:39,040
period will allow you to test them

9826
05:00:39,040 --> 05:00:40,480
further. And what you want to do is put

9827
05:00:40,480 --> 05:00:42,160
Time Doctor. Um it's a it's time

9828
05:00:42,160 --> 05:00:43,200
tracking thing that monitors their

9829
05:00:43,200 --> 05:00:44,480
screen and then you can see how many

9830
05:00:44,480 --> 05:00:45,600
hours they're logging and paid them

9831
05:00:45,600 --> 05:00:47,440
based on those hours. Um now if all

9832
05:00:47,440 --> 05:00:49,040
things go well and after that 30-day

9833
05:00:49,040 --> 05:00:51,280
contract um everything checks out and

9834
05:00:51,280 --> 05:00:52,958
they've delivered good services for your

9835
05:00:52,958 --> 05:00:55,120
on behalf of your agency um then you can

9836
05:00:55,120 --> 05:00:56,878
start looking at a full-time contract um

9837
05:00:56,878 --> 05:00:58,080
and you could lock in a salary. So

9838
05:00:58,080 --> 05:01:00,560
you're getting $3 $4,000 a month um and

9839
05:01:00,560 --> 05:01:02,160
expected hours associated with that

9840
05:01:02,160 --> 05:01:03,920
contract. Um full-time contracts are of

9841
05:01:03,920 --> 05:01:06,080
course a big jump and spending $4,000 a

9842
05:01:06,080 --> 05:01:07,680
month every single month to have someone

9843
05:01:07,680 --> 05:01:09,760
on might seem daunting. Um, but it is

9844
05:01:09,760 --> 05:01:11,680
really key um, in a number of ways. One,

9845
05:01:11,680 --> 05:01:13,040
them working full-time for you is going

9846
05:01:13,040 --> 05:01:14,638
to make sure that all of their focus is

9847
05:01:14,638 --> 05:01:16,320
on your projects and you can put in the

9848
05:01:16,320 --> 05:01:17,840
contract, you are not allowed to work on

9849
05:01:17,840 --> 05:01:19,200
other things. And you will find if

9850
05:01:19,200 --> 05:01:21,120
you're working on Upwork or or even

9851
05:01:21,120 --> 05:01:22,560
people within my community, if that

9852
05:01:22,560 --> 05:01:24,878
juggling multiple projects at once,

9853
05:01:24,878 --> 05:01:26,000
they're going to be giving you a

9854
05:01:26,000 --> 05:01:28,400
fraction of the energy and and time that

9855
05:01:28,400 --> 05:01:30,160
is required to really deliver what you

9856
05:01:30,160 --> 05:01:31,520
need to deliver and meet that standard

9857
05:01:31,520 --> 05:01:32,958
that your clients are expecting. So

9858
05:01:32,958 --> 05:01:34,878
full-time contract, you get their sole

9859
05:01:34,878 --> 05:01:36,958
focus. And also, if you do it right, you

9860
05:01:36,958 --> 05:01:38,480
can make your agency far more profitable

9861
05:01:38,480 --> 05:01:41,040
by using salaried employees rather than

9862
05:01:41,040 --> 05:01:42,638
hourly based on. So full-time contract

9863
05:01:42,638 --> 05:01:44,000
is ideally where you want to get to once

9864
05:01:44,000 --> 05:01:45,840
you have a consistent flow of leads as

9865
05:01:45,840 --> 05:01:46,958
well that are going to make sure that

9866
05:01:46,958 --> 05:01:48,160
you will always have the money to pay

9867
05:01:48,160 --> 05:01:50,000
them. Um, that's what we run at at

9868
05:01:50,000 --> 05:01:51,200
Morningside for basically all of our

9869
05:01:51,200 --> 05:01:52,798
developers unless we're trailing them.

9870
05:01:52,798 --> 05:01:54,160
Um, and finally, you can offer a

9871
05:01:54,160 --> 05:01:55,280
partnership. this is something that

9872
05:01:55,280 --> 05:01:56,878
might be a bit more lucrative. If you

9873
05:01:56,878 --> 05:01:58,480
are making those school post and and

9874
05:01:58,480 --> 05:01:59,440
putting yourself out there and saying,

9875
05:01:59,440 --> 05:02:01,200
"Hey, look, I have a bunch of leads or I

9876
05:02:01,200 --> 05:02:02,638
have connections in XY industry. I'm

9877
05:02:02,638 --> 05:02:03,920
looking for a technical partner to do

9878
05:02:03,920 --> 05:02:05,280
this." You may need to go the

9879
05:02:05,280 --> 05:02:06,718
partnership route and offer some kind of

9880
05:02:06,718 --> 05:02:08,560
revenue share on all of the projects you

9881
05:02:08,560 --> 05:02:10,320
do. So, okay, you're going to get 30% of

9882
05:02:10,320 --> 05:02:11,680
all the revenue for the projects and

9883
05:02:11,680 --> 05:02:14,080
this will attract far better talent um

9884
05:02:14,080 --> 05:02:15,040
because they're going to be more

9885
05:02:15,040 --> 05:02:16,400
incentivized. They're actually tied to

9886
05:02:16,400 --> 05:02:18,160
the earnings rather than just being paid

9887
05:02:18,160 --> 05:02:20,320
paid a wage or paid a salary, right? So,

9888
05:02:20,320 --> 05:02:22,638
that's contract progression and that's

9889
05:02:22,638 --> 05:02:24,480
about it. So key takeaways for this

9890
05:02:24,480 --> 05:02:26,000
video. As I promised in the intro, you

9891
05:02:26,000 --> 05:02:27,360
have determined what developer you need

9892
05:02:27,360 --> 05:02:29,360
for your agency to succeed. It's a AAA

9893
05:02:29,360 --> 05:02:30,638
developer, whether it's a junior or

9894
05:02:30,638 --> 05:02:32,320
senior, depending on your situation. You

9895
05:02:32,320 --> 05:02:34,240
now understand what makes AAA developers

9896
05:02:34,240 --> 05:02:35,600
different, and that is the platforms

9897
05:02:35,600 --> 05:02:37,040
that we use to deliver our specific

9898
05:02:37,040 --> 05:02:38,400
solutions, and that kind of crossover

9899
05:02:38,400 --> 05:02:40,000
between the two worlds of no code and

9900
05:02:40,000 --> 05:02:42,320
traditional AI development. Um, thirdly,

9901
05:02:42,320 --> 05:02:43,840
you know how much to pay your developers

9902
05:02:43,840 --> 05:02:44,878
and those different price ranges,

9903
05:02:44,878 --> 05:02:46,400
whether you need junior or senior, etc.

9904
05:02:46,400 --> 05:02:47,840
And finally, you know the easiest way to

9905
05:02:47,840 --> 05:02:49,840
find a AAA developer for your agency,

9906
05:02:49,840 --> 05:02:51,440
cuz you just need that one person to get

9907
05:02:51,440 --> 05:02:52,718
things off the ground. Really guys, it's

9908
05:02:52,718 --> 05:02:54,560
so important to get that first hire and

9909
05:02:54,560 --> 05:02:55,760
it's it's one of the biggest steps for

9910
05:02:55,760 --> 05:02:57,120
you in succeeding with this long term.

9911
05:02:57,120 --> 05:02:58,320
So go on my school community if you're

9912
05:02:58,320 --> 05:03:00,638
not already. Make a post, network, show

9913
05:03:00,638 --> 05:03:01,920
up to my calls. It's another great way

9914
05:03:01,920 --> 05:03:03,600
to do it. I host a live Q&A every week

9915
05:03:03,600 --> 05:03:05,280
on Friday within my free community. So

9916
05:03:05,280 --> 05:03:06,560
you can hop on there, have a chat with

9917
05:03:06,560 --> 05:03:08,400
me, and if there's an opportunity for

9918
05:03:08,400 --> 05:03:10,320
partnership, you can put your your email

9919
05:03:10,320 --> 05:03:12,000
or your contact details in the chat and

9920
05:03:12,000 --> 05:03:13,280
so many people have been connected by

9921
05:03:13,280 --> 05:03:14,320
that way cuz there's 100 people

9922
05:03:14,320 --> 05:03:15,760
watching, chances are there's someone

9923
05:03:15,760 --> 05:03:16,878
who can help you, is interested in

9924
05:03:16,878 --> 05:03:18,160
partnering with you. So a great way to

9925
05:03:18,160 --> 05:03:19,440
find good talent is to hop on those

9926
05:03:19,440 --> 05:03:23,359
calls and participate in the discussion.

9927
05:03:27,840 --> 05:03:30,400
I wanted to make a uh sort of looking

9928
05:03:30,400 --> 05:03:32,718
forward video into 2025 for those of you

9929
05:03:32,718 --> 05:03:35,520
with an AI automation agency who want to

9930
05:03:35,520 --> 05:03:37,440
really be on the front foot. And I'm

9931
05:03:37,440 --> 05:03:39,120
going to be sharing what I have seen

9932
05:03:39,120 --> 05:03:40,878
significant shifts in the market on my

9933
05:03:40,878 --> 05:03:43,280
end um at Morningside AI and what I

9934
05:03:43,280 --> 05:03:44,958
suspect to be one of the driving forces

9935
05:03:44,958 --> 05:03:47,680
of change and uh really where everything

9936
05:03:47,680 --> 05:03:50,080
is going with the space um within 2025

9937
05:03:50,080 --> 05:03:52,080
and beyond. And so I wanted to make this

9938
05:03:52,080 --> 05:03:53,680
quick vid just breaking down what we're

9939
05:03:53,680 --> 05:03:55,280
seeing on our end and how you guys can

9940
05:03:55,280 --> 05:03:57,360
start to position your agencies to

9941
05:03:57,360 --> 05:03:58,638
benefit from what I think is going to be

9942
05:03:58,638 --> 05:04:01,600
the big shift in the market in 2025. So

9943
05:04:01,600 --> 05:04:04,000
um this goes right back to what I've

9944
05:04:04,000 --> 05:04:06,120
talked about a lot on this channel.

9945
05:04:06,120 --> 05:04:08,320
Basically technology is adopted in

9946
05:04:08,320 --> 05:04:09,680
different phases by different groups of

9947
05:04:09,680 --> 05:04:12,480
people who have different inclinations

9948
05:04:12,480 --> 05:04:13,920
towards the technology. Right? Maybe

9949
05:04:13,920 --> 05:04:15,600
they're an early adopter and they see

9950
05:04:15,600 --> 05:04:17,120
they like to take a bit of a gamble or

9951
05:04:17,120 --> 05:04:19,440
risk on new technology or they're in the

9952
05:04:19,440 --> 05:04:21,200
early majority which are people that

9953
05:04:21,200 --> 05:04:22,718
need to see a bit more proof and

9954
05:04:22,718 --> 05:04:24,240
evidence before they can make a jump and

9955
05:04:24,240 --> 05:04:26,320
take the investment. Um but all of this

9956
05:04:26,320 --> 05:04:28,160
is based around us trying to sell AI

9957
05:04:28,160 --> 05:04:29,840
systems and services and solutions to

9958
05:04:29,840 --> 05:04:31,600
businesses and you're going to get a

9959
05:04:31,600 --> 05:04:33,200
spread of business owners who fall into

9960
05:04:33,200 --> 05:04:35,200
different categories, right? And how

9961
05:04:35,200 --> 05:04:36,638
this relates to the big shift we're

9962
05:04:36,638 --> 05:04:39,360
going to see next year is that for the

9963
05:04:39,360 --> 05:04:41,600
most part we have been focused over the

9964
05:04:41,600 --> 05:04:43,040
past 2 years since I really talked about

9965
05:04:43,040 --> 05:04:44,680
this model and and it's gained so much

9966
05:04:44,680 --> 05:04:46,958
traction. In the past 2 years it's been

9967
05:04:46,958 --> 05:04:48,958
primarily focused on the implementation

9968
05:04:48,958 --> 05:04:51,440
section and this is because we've been

9969
05:04:51,440 --> 05:04:53,600
primarily dealing with uh early adopters

9970
05:04:53,600 --> 05:04:55,360
and by implementation I mean

9971
05:04:55,360 --> 05:04:57,120
implementing AI into their businesses

9972
05:04:57,120 --> 05:04:59,120
like actually building systems for them

9973
05:04:59,120 --> 05:05:00,480
and saying this is going to make some

9974
05:05:00,480 --> 05:05:01,760
kind of meaningful difference in your

9975
05:05:01,760 --> 05:05:03,840
business. So that's implementation and

9976
05:05:03,840 --> 05:05:04,958
that's what we've really been focused on

9977
05:05:04,958 --> 05:05:07,040
is can you get these early adopters or

9978
05:05:07,040 --> 05:05:08,718
business owners who are interested in AI

9979
05:05:08,718 --> 05:05:11,360
and basically profit off of their

9980
05:05:11,360 --> 05:05:13,040
interest and willingness to spend money

9981
05:05:13,040 --> 05:05:14,480
on this on this new technology that

9982
05:05:14,480 --> 05:05:15,760
excites them that they want to get ahead

9983
05:05:15,760 --> 05:05:17,600
with and that's what the AI automation

9984
05:05:17,600 --> 05:05:19,520
agency model up to this point is largely

9985
05:05:19,520 --> 05:05:21,200
being based around which is there's a

9986
05:05:21,200 --> 05:05:22,480
bunch of early adopters who want to

9987
05:05:22,480 --> 05:05:24,718
spend some money we can market ourselves

9988
05:05:24,718 --> 05:05:25,760
through personal branding through

9989
05:05:25,760 --> 05:05:27,120
YouTube through if you're doing like

9990
05:05:27,120 --> 05:05:28,878
cold outbound as well basically get

9991
05:05:28,878 --> 05:05:30,400
yourself in front of these people or try

9992
05:05:30,400 --> 05:05:32,718
to find those who are interested in it

9993
05:05:32,718 --> 05:05:34,400
and offer your services and say, "Hey,

9994
05:05:34,400 --> 05:05:35,200
look, if there's something that you

9995
05:05:35,200 --> 05:05:37,280
wouldd like to build um we can do it for

9996
05:05:37,280 --> 05:05:39,520
you or even identifying a more specific

9997
05:05:39,520 --> 05:05:41,440
offer that you sell um that you've

9998
05:05:41,440 --> 05:05:42,638
really dialed in and you found, hey,

9999
05:05:42,638 --> 05:05:44,240
this is a great offer to sell and you're

10000
05:05:44,240 --> 05:05:45,760
reaching out to businesses and trying to

10001
05:05:45,760 --> 05:05:47,680
say, hey, I can do this for you." And

10002
05:05:47,680 --> 05:05:49,040
then providing a bit more proof. So,

10003
05:05:49,040 --> 05:05:51,040
that's more so dealing with the early

10004
05:05:51,040 --> 05:05:52,480
majority and trying to sell to people

10005
05:05:52,480 --> 05:05:54,958
who aren't necessarily implementation or

10006
05:05:54,958 --> 05:05:57,680
or ready for AI systems or aware enough

10007
05:05:57,680 --> 05:05:59,200
about the problem and or about the

10008
05:05:59,200 --> 05:06:00,718
benefits they provide. The key is that

10009
05:06:00,718 --> 05:06:02,400
the implementation layer that we've been

10010
05:06:02,400 --> 05:06:04,718
so focused on is actually what we've

10011
05:06:04,718 --> 05:06:06,798
realized at Morningside AI uh over the

10012
05:06:06,798 --> 05:06:08,798
past say 3 to six months as we've been

10013
05:06:08,798 --> 05:06:10,240
working with our our consulting division

10014
05:06:10,240 --> 05:06:12,240
that we've set up here in New Zealand is

10015
05:06:12,240 --> 05:06:14,798
that the implementation step is actually

10016
05:06:14,798 --> 05:06:17,680
kind of way way down the pipeline and

10017
05:06:17,680 --> 05:06:19,680
it's really a late stage way of

10018
05:06:19,680 --> 05:06:21,520
capturing value in the AI space as an

10019
05:06:21,520 --> 05:06:23,680
agency and you've got a lot that happens

10020
05:06:23,680 --> 05:06:25,680
before that and while it has been good

10021
05:06:25,680 --> 05:06:27,280
to start off initially and just deal

10022
05:06:27,280 --> 05:06:29,200
with the implementation uh and selling

10023
05:06:29,200 --> 05:06:30,958
implementation for businesses who are

10024
05:06:30,958 --> 05:06:32,560
ready for it and and are eager for it.

10025
05:06:32,560 --> 05:06:34,080
Sure, that's been a great way for us to

10026
05:06:34,080 --> 05:06:35,600
get our agency off the ground and as for

10027
05:06:35,600 --> 05:06:37,920
many of you guys as well, we see that

10028
05:06:37,920 --> 05:06:39,440
there's a much bigger opportunity going

10029
05:06:39,440 --> 05:06:41,840
into 2025 and a slightly different

10030
05:06:41,840 --> 05:06:43,760
model. And I mean, if you go right back

10031
05:06:43,760 --> 05:06:45,360
to when I first started talking about

10032
05:06:45,360 --> 05:06:48,480
the AI automation agency model, it was

10033
05:06:48,480 --> 05:06:50,160
aimed at small to mediumsiz businesses

10034
05:06:50,160 --> 05:06:51,600
and helping them to implement and

10035
05:06:51,600 --> 05:06:54,080
integrate AI into their business. And it

10036
05:06:54,080 --> 05:06:55,920
was always really leaning towards you

10037
05:06:55,920 --> 05:06:57,520
are going to be there in the same way

10038
05:06:57,520 --> 05:06:59,120
that social media marketing agencies

10039
05:06:59,120 --> 05:07:01,200
were the people who helped businesses to

10040
05:07:01,200 --> 05:07:03,280
move online and start uh not necessarily

10041
05:07:03,280 --> 05:07:04,718
move online not like set up their

10042
05:07:04,718 --> 05:07:06,718
website but when they do that sometimes

10043
05:07:06,718 --> 05:07:08,480
but move into social media marketing and

10044
05:07:08,480 --> 05:07:10,480
start start being their guide to getting

10045
05:07:10,480 --> 05:07:13,040
into the uh digital marketing era and

10046
05:07:13,040 --> 05:07:14,560
that's what the AI automation agency

10047
05:07:14,560 --> 05:07:16,240
model is ultimately going to move

10048
05:07:16,240 --> 05:07:18,798
towards uh in the long run but next year

10049
05:07:18,798 --> 05:07:20,320
is when I really see that shift taking

10050
05:07:20,320 --> 05:07:22,000
place and that you're going to see us

10051
05:07:22,000 --> 05:07:24,000
moving more towards or the agencies who

10052
05:07:24,000 --> 05:07:26,320
really succeed, moving more towards

10053
05:07:26,320 --> 05:07:28,638
being the AI transformation partner for

10054
05:07:28,638 --> 05:07:30,240
businesses. And whether that's being

10055
05:07:30,240 --> 05:07:31,920
general, which may be quite difficult,

10056
05:07:31,920 --> 05:07:33,840
or niching down to saying, "Hey, I I'm

10057
05:07:33,840 --> 05:07:35,600
the AI transformation partner for," and

10058
05:07:35,600 --> 05:07:37,360
then I'll explain exactly what that

10059
05:07:37,360 --> 05:07:39,920
means on a implementation and on a like

10060
05:07:39,920 --> 05:07:42,000
operational standpoint in a second, but

10061
05:07:42,000 --> 05:07:43,520
saying we are we help plumbing

10062
05:07:43,520 --> 05:07:45,840
businesses transition into the AIH. It's

10063
05:07:45,840 --> 05:07:47,280
basically the the offer that you're

10064
05:07:47,280 --> 05:07:48,798
you're helping them out with, right? Or

10065
05:07:48,798 --> 05:07:50,080
that you're pres you're presenting to

10066
05:07:50,080 --> 05:07:52,638
them. And so the way this would look is

10067
05:07:52,638 --> 05:07:54,320
we see that Morning Side AI, we're

10068
05:07:54,320 --> 05:07:56,878
starting to identify these real key

10069
05:07:56,878 --> 05:07:59,440
areas uh that your agency can can focus

10070
05:07:59,440 --> 05:08:01,600
on and can provide value to businesses.

10071
05:08:01,600 --> 05:08:04,080
And this really allows you to tap into a

10072
05:08:04,080 --> 05:08:06,400
much larger chunk of that market of of

10073
05:08:06,400 --> 05:08:07,680
business owners, right? The technology

10074
05:08:07,680 --> 05:08:10,000
adoption life cycle. We've got these big

10075
05:08:10,000 --> 05:08:12,240
chunks of the business owner population

10076
05:08:12,240 --> 05:08:14,480
in in your given niche who are not ready

10077
05:08:14,480 --> 05:08:16,480
for AI implementation yet. But this

10078
05:08:16,480 --> 05:08:17,760
strategy that I'm talking about right

10079
05:08:17,760 --> 05:08:19,680
now essentially allows you to tap into

10080
05:08:19,680 --> 05:08:22,080
pretty much the entire uh spectrum and

10081
05:08:22,080 --> 05:08:23,840
everyone in the market because you're

10082
05:08:23,840 --> 05:08:25,120
taking a different approach than going

10083
05:08:25,120 --> 05:08:27,520
straight from implementation. Right? So

10084
05:08:27,520 --> 05:08:29,920
this strategy this AI transformation

10085
05:08:29,920 --> 05:08:33,680
partner kind of offer starts with basic

10086
05:08:33,680 --> 05:08:35,200
education. Right? So that's taking

10087
05:08:35,200 --> 05:08:36,480
businesses. We've found in our own

10088
05:08:36,480 --> 05:08:37,920
consulting business that we've started

10089
05:08:37,920 --> 05:08:40,080
here that you go to some of these

10090
05:08:40,080 --> 05:08:42,320
companies and they just know absolutely

10091
05:08:42,320 --> 05:08:44,480
nothing. And even at this point, they

10092
05:08:44,480 --> 05:08:46,480
still at the starting blocks and this is

10093
05:08:46,480 --> 05:08:48,878
in New Zealand. We are not on the most

10094
05:08:48,878 --> 05:08:50,560
on the front foot necessarily with AI

10095
05:08:50,560 --> 05:08:52,240
here in the States. it might be a little

10096
05:08:52,240 --> 05:08:54,718
bit uh more common for businesses to be

10097
05:08:54,718 --> 05:08:56,160
making moves, but I'd say on the most

10098
05:08:56,160 --> 05:08:57,600
part, if you go and start knocking on

10099
05:08:57,600 --> 05:08:59,200
doors around your your city, if you're

10100
05:08:59,200 --> 05:09:00,160
living in the States, if you're living

10101
05:09:00,160 --> 05:09:01,600
anywhere, and you start knocking on

10102
05:09:01,600 --> 05:09:03,440
doors of businesses and ask them about

10103
05:09:03,440 --> 05:09:05,840
what do you know about AI and uh what

10104
05:09:05,840 --> 05:09:07,520
benefits does it present? What are the

10105
05:09:07,520 --> 05:09:09,200
risks? Um have you thought about in

10106
05:09:09,200 --> 05:09:10,878
implementing it? You ask them all these

10107
05:09:10,878 --> 05:09:12,160
basic questions and the business owner

10108
05:09:12,160 --> 05:09:13,680
just like, "Mate, I have no clue what

10109
05:09:13,680 --> 05:09:15,840
you're talking about and I'm not really

10110
05:09:15,840 --> 05:09:18,320
that interested in it. Sure, I'd like to

10111
05:09:18,320 --> 05:09:20,718
make more money and spend less. Um, but

10112
05:09:20,718 --> 05:09:22,718
I don't know what this AI stuff is. So,

10113
05:09:22,718 --> 05:09:24,958
step one is that there's a huge

10114
05:09:24,958 --> 05:09:27,680
opportunity for just basic education.

10115
05:09:27,680 --> 05:09:30,638
And there's the whole population of

10116
05:09:30,638 --> 05:09:31,760
business owners need to be brought up to

10117
05:09:31,760 --> 05:09:33,440
speed in it just like they did with what

10118
05:09:33,440 --> 05:09:35,120
is a website and why the hell should I

10119
05:09:35,120 --> 05:09:36,798
put it in? Why the [ __ ] would I spend

10120
05:09:36,798 --> 05:09:39,520
money on getting a website set up?

10121
05:09:39,520 --> 05:09:41,200
Right? This we have the same opportunity

10122
05:09:41,200 --> 05:09:42,798
now. And yes, we've been focused so much

10123
05:09:42,798 --> 05:09:44,958
on implementation, but you go back like

10124
05:09:44,958 --> 05:09:46,638
two steps. I I'll explain the rest in a

10125
05:09:46,638 --> 05:09:48,480
second. And the first thing is just what

10126
05:09:48,480 --> 05:09:51,040
is the technology? What what what does

10127
05:09:51,040 --> 05:09:53,360
it actually do? Uh what are the risks

10128
05:09:53,360 --> 05:09:56,400
with it? And like what are what what's

10129
05:09:56,400 --> 05:09:57,680
the difficulties of me getting to the

10130
05:09:57,680 --> 05:09:58,718
point where I actually get some value

10131
05:09:58,718 --> 05:10:00,638
out of it. So, we see there as as being

10132
05:10:00,638 --> 05:10:02,798
a big opportunity if you're really

10133
05:10:02,798 --> 05:10:05,120
looking to scale into 2025 and beyond so

10134
05:10:05,120 --> 05:10:06,878
that you can tap into say your entire

10135
05:10:06,878 --> 05:10:08,958
niche, not just the plumbers who are and

10136
05:10:08,958 --> 05:10:10,798
I'm using plumbing as an example, but

10137
05:10:10,798 --> 05:10:12,638
not just the plumbing businesses who are

10138
05:10:12,638 --> 05:10:15,360
watching my videos or are kind of really

10139
05:10:15,360 --> 05:10:17,200
really techy and and they're ready for

10140
05:10:17,200 --> 05:10:18,400
implementation and they're aware of what

10141
05:10:18,400 --> 05:10:20,878
AI is, which would be obviously a very

10142
05:10:20,878 --> 05:10:22,480
small portion of the the plumber

10143
05:10:22,480 --> 05:10:24,080
business owner population. But by

10144
05:10:24,080 --> 05:10:25,840
positioning your business in a in a in a

10145
05:10:25,840 --> 05:10:27,440
way that says look we can actually do

10146
05:10:27,440 --> 05:10:29,120
the education section so we can start to

10147
05:10:29,120 --> 05:10:31,440
convert that 97% of people who are not

10148
05:10:31,440 --> 05:10:33,280
interested and start to move them down

10149
05:10:33,280 --> 05:10:34,958
the the pipeline towards being

10150
05:10:34,958 --> 05:10:37,400
implementation ready. That is step one.

10151
05:10:37,400 --> 05:10:40,400
So step one would be education. Okay.

10152
05:10:40,400 --> 05:10:42,480
Can you go I use plumbing as an example

10153
05:10:42,480 --> 05:10:43,760
again but this is for any niche. This is

10154
05:10:43,760 --> 05:10:45,120
when being niched down is probably going

10155
05:10:45,120 --> 05:10:47,120
to be the significant advantage because

10156
05:10:47,120 --> 05:10:48,480
it's going to vary from industry to

10157
05:10:48,480 --> 05:10:50,400
industry, right? We're saying we help

10158
05:10:50,400 --> 05:10:52,400
XYZ types of businesses to transition

10159
05:10:52,400 --> 05:10:53,480
into the

10160
05:10:53,480 --> 05:10:55,520
AIH. There's there's different wording

10161
05:10:55,520 --> 05:10:56,638
for that. I mean, that's probably not

10162
05:10:56,638 --> 05:10:58,400
what we would ultimately go for for the

10163
05:10:58,400 --> 05:10:59,680
the offer that we're working on in

10164
05:10:59,680 --> 05:11:01,600
Morningside AI, but that's the the main

10165
05:11:01,600 --> 05:11:02,798
concept of it, right? So, you've got

10166
05:11:02,798 --> 05:11:05,280
education first. What is a tech? And

10167
05:11:05,280 --> 05:11:06,638
then the next step after that is once

10168
05:11:06,638 --> 05:11:07,718
they've got that foundational

10169
05:11:07,718 --> 05:11:10,638
understanding, it's like, okay, now

10170
05:11:10,638 --> 05:11:12,638
let's go into use case identification.

10171
05:11:12,638 --> 05:11:14,160
And this is what we see as the kind of

10172
05:11:14,160 --> 05:11:16,080
consulting portion and where we've

10173
05:11:16,080 --> 05:11:17,360
learned from our own consulting team

10174
05:11:17,360 --> 05:11:20,240
that there's this really key need of use

10175
05:11:20,240 --> 05:11:21,680
case identification with the businesses

10176
05:11:21,680 --> 05:11:23,200
and a team that can go through and do a

10177
05:11:23,200 --> 05:11:26,958
really rapid and efficient AI audit and

10178
05:11:26,958 --> 05:11:29,920
that we see as a second layer of of this

10179
05:11:29,920 --> 05:11:31,760
this new kind of AI transformation offer

10180
05:11:31,760 --> 05:11:33,760
where you've educated them okay now we

10181
05:11:33,760 --> 05:11:35,840
can actually have a proper productive

10182
05:11:35,840 --> 05:11:38,560
discussion about what this stuff can do

10183
05:11:38,560 --> 05:11:40,400
for your business. So you've understood

10184
05:11:40,400 --> 05:11:42,240
the foundations. Now the next layer on

10185
05:11:42,240 --> 05:11:44,320
top of that is what can it actually do

10186
05:11:44,320 --> 05:11:45,680
for your business. Let's run through

10187
05:11:45,680 --> 05:11:47,440
some of the systems you have right now.

10188
05:11:47,440 --> 05:11:49,200
Let's identify any of the lowhanging

10189
05:11:49,200 --> 05:11:50,958
fruit. Let's do a breakdown of okay well

10190
05:11:50,958 --> 05:11:54,480
these big opportunities the the uh the

10191
05:11:54,480 --> 05:11:56,000
difficulty value matrix which I've

10192
05:11:56,000 --> 05:11:57,200
talked about on the channel here before.

10193
05:11:57,200 --> 05:11:59,920
Again I'll link a video to it in the

10194
05:11:59,920 --> 05:12:01,760
description or somewhere here. A lot of

10195
05:12:01,760 --> 05:12:02,798
the stuff I've already talked about

10196
05:12:02,798 --> 05:12:04,638
before. Um but I know we often need to

10197
05:12:04,638 --> 05:12:07,840
be reminded uh more than we need to be.

10198
05:12:07,840 --> 05:12:10,240
How how does it go? We often need what

10199
05:12:10,240 --> 05:12:12,958
is that saying? We need to be reminded

10200
05:12:12,958 --> 05:12:15,600
more than we need to be told.

10201
05:12:15,600 --> 05:12:17,840
Oh,

10202
05:12:18,120 --> 05:12:20,560
no. We need to be reminded more than we

10203
05:12:20,560 --> 05:12:21,840
need to be taught. So again, I'm just

10204
05:12:21,840 --> 05:12:22,878
reminding you of the things that I've

10205
05:12:22,878 --> 05:12:24,000
I've talked about here before, but

10206
05:12:24,000 --> 05:12:25,200
basically walking through use case

10207
05:12:25,200 --> 05:12:27,760
identification with them. Where do these

10208
05:12:27,760 --> 05:12:29,040
things that we've discovered and

10209
05:12:29,040 --> 05:12:30,160
identified within your business and

10210
05:12:30,160 --> 05:12:31,520
where do they fall on the difficulty

10211
05:12:31,520 --> 05:12:33,760
value matrix? like how there's some low

10212
05:12:33,760 --> 05:12:36,320
hanging fruit, some some quick wins that

10213
05:12:36,320 --> 05:12:38,080
are not very difficult to implement but

10214
05:12:38,080 --> 05:12:39,840
are hugely valuable and what are the

10215
05:12:39,840 --> 05:12:41,280
longerterm projects that we can look at

10216
05:12:41,280 --> 05:12:42,958
that are going to be high value but also

10217
05:12:42,958 --> 05:12:45,040
high difficulty and take time and so

10218
05:12:45,040 --> 05:12:46,718
being able to make a bit of a road map

10219
05:12:46,718 --> 05:12:48,320
or a timeline and how they can start to

10220
05:12:48,320 --> 05:12:50,400
take those off then you are ready for

10221
05:12:50,400 --> 05:12:52,320
the implementation section and then we

10222
05:12:52,320 --> 05:12:53,520
get to what we've all kind of been

10223
05:12:53,520 --> 05:12:55,040
familiar with with this AI automation

10224
05:12:55,040 --> 05:12:56,400
agency which is actually using our

10225
05:12:56,400 --> 05:12:58,240
development teams to build the systems

10226
05:12:58,240 --> 05:12:59,840
for them and then go through the the

10227
05:12:59,840 --> 05:13:01,200
cycles of iteration to get them

10228
05:13:01,200 --> 05:13:03,280
performing and then managing that system

10229
05:13:03,280 --> 05:13:04,718
moving forward. So I guess

10230
05:13:04,718 --> 05:13:06,400
implementation would be one and then

10231
05:13:06,400 --> 05:13:07,680
you've even got another step after that

10232
05:13:07,680 --> 05:13:09,600
which is ongoing optimization and

10233
05:13:09,600 --> 05:13:11,160
maintenance.

10234
05:13:11,160 --> 05:13:13,680
So, so technically there's four parts of

10235
05:13:13,680 --> 05:13:16,160
that, right? The education, what is the

10236
05:13:16,160 --> 05:13:18,560
stuff, consulting, and use case

10237
05:13:18,560 --> 05:13:20,080
notification, how can this actually help

10238
05:13:20,080 --> 05:13:21,760
my business, how does it apply to my

10239
05:13:21,760 --> 05:13:24,000
business, implementation, okay, let's

10240
05:13:24,000 --> 05:13:25,360
actually build this now, and then the

10241
05:13:25,360 --> 05:13:27,040
ongoing maintenance. So, there's four

10242
05:13:27,040 --> 05:13:28,480
different ways that you can create value

10243
05:13:28,480 --> 05:13:30,320
and sell things to them, right? And that

10244
05:13:30,320 --> 05:13:32,160
can either be sold as a package where

10245
05:13:32,160 --> 05:13:33,280
it's like, okay, this is going to be

10246
05:13:33,280 --> 05:13:36,400
$15,000 for me to we help plumbers to

10247
05:13:36,400 --> 05:13:38,080
move from here to here. we have this

10248
05:13:38,080 --> 05:13:39,840
complete offer and we're going to walk

10249
05:13:39,840 --> 05:13:42,240
you through step by step by step or you

10250
05:13:42,240 --> 05:13:43,520
can start to like kind of make that more

10251
05:13:43,520 --> 05:13:45,360
peace meal and you can say hey we have

10252
05:13:45,360 --> 05:13:47,600
this free education offer and then you

10253
05:13:47,600 --> 05:13:49,040
can advertise directly to plumbers you

10254
05:13:49,040 --> 05:13:50,400
can go to you can go to plumbing

10255
05:13:50,400 --> 05:13:52,400
conventions again plumbing as the

10256
05:13:52,400 --> 05:13:55,440
example um and then you can say okay

10257
05:13:55,440 --> 05:13:56,798
well I'm going to do the education I'll

10258
05:13:56,798 --> 05:13:58,160
actually give the education away for

10259
05:13:58,160 --> 05:14:00,080
free and build some trust with these

10260
05:14:00,080 --> 05:14:02,320
plumbers and say I am the go-to guy for

10261
05:14:02,320 --> 05:14:04,320
AI and your plumbing business and then

10262
05:14:04,320 --> 05:14:05,440
you can sell them on the use case

10263
05:14:05,440 --> 05:14:06,798
identification you oh actually we've got

10264
05:14:06,798 --> 05:14:09,360
a 200 00and package for um use case

10265
05:14:09,360 --> 05:14:10,718
identification. You'll work with our

10266
05:14:10,718 --> 05:14:12,320
consultants directly. We'll run through

10267
05:14:12,320 --> 05:14:13,760
a whole process and identify the best

10268
05:14:13,760 --> 05:14:15,200
ways that you can use AI within your

10269
05:14:15,200 --> 05:14:16,878
business. And if you are smart about it,

10270
05:14:16,878 --> 05:14:18,878
you do stay niche down cuz you can just

10271
05:14:18,878 --> 05:14:20,878
keep doing it's based like how how

10272
05:14:20,878 --> 05:14:22,560
different can one plumbing business be

10273
05:14:22,560 --> 05:14:23,920
from the other. You actually aren't

10274
05:14:23,920 --> 05:14:25,600
having to reinvent the wheel each time

10275
05:14:25,600 --> 05:14:27,600
with this use case identification. There

10276
05:14:27,600 --> 05:14:29,680
may be some differences, but for the

10277
05:14:29,680 --> 05:14:31,120
most part, it would be like booking

10278
05:14:31,120 --> 05:14:33,280
systems or, you know, like optimizing

10279
05:14:33,280 --> 05:14:35,240
schedules and and stuff like that.

10280
05:14:35,240 --> 05:14:38,240
So the use case identification package

10281
05:14:38,240 --> 05:14:39,840
could become pretty lucrative as well.

10282
05:14:39,840 --> 05:14:41,520
And then you have the team as well to

10283
05:14:41,520 --> 05:14:42,878
sell it. And whether you are, this is

10284
05:14:42,878 --> 05:14:44,400
when it becomes actually really good for

10285
05:14:44,400 --> 05:14:46,560
people who are non-technical because if

10286
05:14:46,560 --> 05:14:48,000
you get to the point where I'm like

10287
05:14:48,000 --> 05:14:49,760
you're really good at selling, you might

10288
05:14:49,760 --> 05:14:51,280
be good at getting on camera or writing

10289
05:14:51,280 --> 05:14:53,280
and you can really market yourself or

10290
05:14:53,280 --> 05:14:54,560
you've always been very much on the

10291
05:14:54,560 --> 05:14:56,080
sales or or marketing side of of a

10292
05:14:56,080 --> 05:14:58,000
business or that's just the way you lean

10293
05:14:58,000 --> 05:14:59,760
kind of naturally. You can do your

10294
05:14:59,760 --> 05:15:01,120
thing. you can become hey I'm going to

10295
05:15:01,120 --> 05:15:02,560
be the educator and I'm going to have

10296
05:15:02,560 --> 05:15:03,920
this team of consultants and then when

10297
05:15:03,920 --> 05:15:05,600
it comes to implementation I'm not going

10298
05:15:05,600 --> 05:15:07,440
to have my own team of devs I'm going to

10299
05:15:07,440 --> 05:15:09,120
be passing off to dev partners say you

10300
05:15:09,120 --> 05:15:10,718
go into my free community or if you're

10301
05:15:10,718 --> 05:15:12,000
part of my accelerator you can network

10302
05:15:12,000 --> 05:15:13,280
with the the guys who are really doing

10303
05:15:13,280 --> 05:15:15,280
numbers in there and you find capable

10304
05:15:15,280 --> 05:15:16,958
development partners who don't want to

10305
05:15:16,958 --> 05:15:18,400
do the marketing who don't want to do

10306
05:15:18,400 --> 05:15:20,080
all this selling crap that they don't

10307
05:15:20,080 --> 05:15:22,560
that's never really part of their mo and

10308
05:15:22,560 --> 05:15:23,760
stuff that they want to do as a

10309
05:15:23,760 --> 05:15:25,680
developer and then you can just pass

10310
05:15:25,680 --> 05:15:27,520
them off and say hey look we'll take 20%

10311
05:15:27,520 --> 05:15:30,320
of any deals we send you And these are

10312
05:15:30,320 --> 05:15:32,160
going to be our implementation partners.

10313
05:15:32,160 --> 05:15:34,080
And that way you get to flex this

10314
05:15:34,080 --> 05:15:35,440
business model to what you need. And if

10315
05:15:35,440 --> 05:15:36,878
you're a development partner, you can

10316
05:15:36,878 --> 05:15:38,240
find people who are doing the strategy

10317
05:15:38,240 --> 05:15:40,080
and doing the educating and you get to

10318
05:15:40,080 --> 05:15:41,520
just get the leads that you want. And if

10319
05:15:41,520 --> 05:15:43,920
you think often if it's custom

10320
05:15:43,920 --> 05:15:46,240
development, your margins maybe, I don't

10321
05:15:46,240 --> 05:15:49,760
know, 50 or 60%. And so if you are a

10322
05:15:49,760 --> 05:15:51,360
markety sales person who's going to be

10323
05:15:51,360 --> 05:15:53,280
doing that education and priming them

10324
05:15:53,280 --> 05:15:55,600
for that implementation step, the actual

10325
05:15:55,600 --> 05:15:57,600
real value creation and how sort of you

10326
05:15:57,600 --> 05:15:59,040
get hundreds of thousands of dollars in

10327
05:15:59,040 --> 05:16:00,718
savings and you're passing it off and

10328
05:16:00,718 --> 05:16:03,920
getting 15 to 20%. I mean like that's

10329
05:16:03,920 --> 05:16:05,920
you're almost there. If a project runs

10330
05:16:05,920 --> 05:16:08,878
runs along and you end up going uh over

10331
05:16:08,878 --> 05:16:11,600
over um the expected timeline, you could

10332
05:16:11,600 --> 05:16:14,240
only end up profiting 20% and you've had

10333
05:16:14,240 --> 05:16:15,600
to have the whole div team and do all of

10334
05:16:15,600 --> 05:16:16,798
the management yourself. So, it can

10335
05:16:16,798 --> 05:16:18,240
actually be pretty like if you're just

10336
05:16:18,240 --> 05:16:20,080
getting 20% pure profit for just passing

10337
05:16:20,080 --> 05:16:21,600
it off, it's not actually that much

10338
05:16:21,600 --> 05:16:23,440
worse. You're making like half the

10339
05:16:23,440 --> 05:16:25,520
profit that a full dev agency would be

10340
05:16:25,520 --> 05:16:27,760
making, but with 0% of the headache that

10341
05:16:27,760 --> 05:16:29,200
comes with running the whole div. So,

10342
05:16:29,200 --> 05:16:31,360
it's not to say I highly recommend you

10343
05:16:31,360 --> 05:16:33,360
should just go and sell it and then pass

10344
05:16:33,360 --> 05:16:35,040
it off. That's just a strategy that you

10345
05:16:35,040 --> 05:16:37,920
can adopt. And my point here with this

10346
05:16:37,920 --> 05:16:39,200
whole video is that I think this is

10347
05:16:39,200 --> 05:16:40,718
where this is where we see it going.

10348
05:16:40,718 --> 05:16:42,160
This is where we are moving our agency.

10349
05:16:42,160 --> 05:16:43,600
And I'm going to update you more on that

10350
05:16:43,600 --> 05:16:46,320
next year. But we see this as really the

10351
05:16:46,320 --> 05:16:48,878
uh the opportunity to scale hard into

10352
05:16:48,878 --> 05:16:50,638
different industries because once you

10353
05:16:50,638 --> 05:16:51,920
have that offer, you've got I have

10354
05:16:51,920 --> 05:16:53,840
education for them. I have a great team

10355
05:16:53,840 --> 05:16:55,280
of consultants that I can or a

10356
05:16:55,280 --> 05:16:56,798
consulting strategy at least like a

10357
05:16:56,798 --> 05:16:58,240
system where you can get one of your

10358
05:16:58,240 --> 05:16:59,680
team on and they go on and they walk

10359
05:16:59,680 --> 05:17:01,520
through this this this this great we've

10360
05:17:01,520 --> 05:17:03,200
got that that's a you can sell that as a

10361
05:17:03,200 --> 05:17:04,400
package or you can just have it as part

10362
05:17:04,400 --> 05:17:06,400
of this whole package as well. But then

10363
05:17:06,400 --> 05:17:08,400
you get you unlock that technology

10364
05:17:08,400 --> 05:17:10,480
adoption life cycle. you unlock a

10365
05:17:10,480 --> 05:17:12,560
significant chunk of the market when now

10366
05:17:12,560 --> 05:17:14,400
you can market to any business owner

10367
05:17:14,400 --> 05:17:15,520
because you have something for every

10368
05:17:15,520 --> 05:17:17,760
stage of the readiness like hey okay

10369
05:17:17,760 --> 05:17:19,040
let's do a quick questionnaire do you

10370
05:17:19,040 --> 05:17:20,878
know about AI and what are things yeah

10371
05:17:20,878 --> 05:17:22,400
I've got a pretty good idea okay great

10372
05:17:22,400 --> 05:17:24,240
well do you know where it can best help

10373
05:17:24,240 --> 05:17:26,400
your business oh no yeah that's really

10374
05:17:26,400 --> 05:17:27,520
where we're stuck but not sure okay

10375
05:17:27,520 --> 05:17:28,480
great well we've got a consulting

10376
05:17:28,480 --> 05:17:30,000
package we can get you straight onto

10377
05:17:30,000 --> 05:17:31,360
that and then after that we've got some

10378
05:17:31,360 --> 05:17:32,878
great partners that we can help you uh

10379
05:17:32,878 --> 05:17:34,400
connect with or we can actually build it

10380
05:17:34,400 --> 05:17:36,638
for yourself and then there's another

10381
05:17:36,638 --> 05:17:37,920
opportunity that comes off the back of

10382
05:17:37,920 --> 05:17:39,680
that that we are eyeing up particularly

10383
05:17:39,680 --> 05:17:42,240
at Morningside AI and that's if you did

10384
05:17:42,240 --> 05:17:44,080
have a group of dev partners say you

10385
05:17:44,080 --> 05:17:45,360
were doing this make me make a package

10386
05:17:45,360 --> 05:17:47,920
that's say 15 or $20,000 for this AI

10387
05:17:47,920 --> 05:17:49,520
transformation that's end to end you've

10388
05:17:49,520 --> 05:17:52,160
taken them from basic education you've

10389
05:17:52,160 --> 05:17:53,440
even got maybe a layer of staff

10390
05:17:53,440 --> 05:17:54,718
education in there as well where it's

10391
05:17:54,718 --> 05:17:57,200
like upskilling them as well consulting

10392
05:17:57,200 --> 05:17:59,040
implementation maintenance etc and then

10393
05:17:59,040 --> 05:18:00,718
if you're really smart you can hand off

10394
05:18:00,718 --> 05:18:02,400
all of the kind of lower ticket smaller

10395
05:18:02,400 --> 05:18:03,920
stuff to your dev agencies that you

10396
05:18:03,920 --> 05:18:05,920
identify with them your partners and

10397
05:18:05,920 --> 05:18:07,520
then if there's one really interesting

10398
05:18:07,520 --> 05:18:09,040
thing that you're like wow I think we

10399
05:18:09,040 --> 05:18:10,080
could build something around that and

10400
05:18:10,080 --> 05:18:11,280
actually start to sell it to other

10401
05:18:11,280 --> 05:18:13,040
businesses within that niche. Then you

10402
05:18:13,040 --> 05:18:14,480
say we're going to put our dev team on

10403
05:18:14,480 --> 05:18:16,080
this one. It might be like a really

10404
05:18:16,080 --> 05:18:17,600
complex sales system, but you know it's

10405
05:18:17,600 --> 05:18:19,200
going to drive a ton of value. Or we've

10406
05:18:19,200 --> 05:18:20,638
had things that have popped up recently

10407
05:18:20,638 --> 05:18:22,560
in the consulting we do around say like

10408
05:18:22,560 --> 05:18:24,240
a computer vision inventory management

10409
05:18:24,240 --> 05:18:26,718
system and say, well, if we build that,

10410
05:18:26,718 --> 05:18:28,160
we could actually then start to sell

10411
05:18:28,160 --> 05:18:29,440
that to other businesses in that niche

10412
05:18:29,440 --> 05:18:30,718
and you start to build up a bit of a

10413
05:18:30,718 --> 05:18:33,360
portfolio of these software solutions,

10414
05:18:33,360 --> 05:18:35,680
AR software solutions that are massively

10415
05:18:35,680 --> 05:18:37,280
useful and you've got a great case study

10416
05:18:37,280 --> 05:18:38,718
to then go and sell it on to other

10417
05:18:38,718 --> 05:18:40,000
people. So that's how you can start to

10418
05:18:40,000 --> 05:18:41,600
build a bit of a software portfolio as

10419
05:18:41,600 --> 05:18:42,280
well.

10420
05:18:42,280 --> 05:18:44,878
So, I I don't want to go much deeper on

10421
05:18:44,878 --> 05:18:46,878
that cuz I'll I'll take a window out of

10422
05:18:46,878 --> 05:18:48,400
my sales for next year and what what

10423
05:18:48,400 --> 05:18:50,400
we're doing at Morningside, but I

10424
05:18:50,400 --> 05:18:51,920
thought I'd put you guys onto a bit of

10425
05:18:51,920 --> 05:18:53,600
game there as to where I see the market

10426
05:18:53,600 --> 05:18:55,080
moving. And I

10427
05:18:55,080 --> 05:18:57,200
think this is something you should all

10428
05:18:57,200 --> 05:18:58,958
be considering if you you might have a

10429
05:18:58,958 --> 05:19:00,160
good thing going with the implementation

10430
05:19:00,160 --> 05:19:01,760
already and you got a good good amount

10431
05:19:01,760 --> 05:19:04,480
of momentum. But looking further ahead

10432
05:19:04,480 --> 05:19:06,160
and if you really want to unlock a

10433
05:19:06,160 --> 05:19:07,600
bigger chunk of the market now that we

10434
05:19:07,600 --> 05:19:08,480
are getting a little bit more

10435
05:19:08,480 --> 05:19:09,680
competition, there's more people trying

10436
05:19:09,680 --> 05:19:11,120
to come after this. That's not to say

10437
05:19:11,120 --> 05:19:12,958
we're late. I still think we are so so

10438
05:19:12,958 --> 05:19:14,718
bloody early to this. When you when you

10439
05:19:14,718 --> 05:19:16,000
again when you do the knock on the door

10440
05:19:16,000 --> 05:19:17,680
test and there's like no businesses

10441
05:19:17,680 --> 05:19:19,760
using it. Um it shows that we are still

10442
05:19:19,760 --> 05:19:22,240
so early. Uh but this is something you

10443
05:19:22,240 --> 05:19:23,840
should look to be doing. Hey, how can I

10444
05:19:23,840 --> 05:19:26,160
start to unlock and tap into more of

10445
05:19:26,160 --> 05:19:28,080
this untapped market? And it's not just

10446
05:19:28,080 --> 05:19:30,000
those early adopters who are really

10447
05:19:30,000 --> 05:19:32,160
ready for this technology already, but I

10448
05:19:32,160 --> 05:19:33,840
want to start accessing that bigger part

10449
05:19:33,840 --> 05:19:35,440
of the early majority and even the late

10450
05:19:35,440 --> 05:19:37,680
majority by being able to give them a

10451
05:19:37,680 --> 05:19:38,638
much more beginner friend for anything

10452
05:19:38,638 --> 05:19:40,878
and say, look, hey, AI is really going

10453
05:19:40,878 --> 05:19:42,798
to appreciate the industry. I know it

10454
05:19:42,798 --> 05:19:44,638
can seem quite scary and daunting, but

10455
05:19:44,638 --> 05:19:45,920
if you give me I've got this free

10456
05:19:45,920 --> 05:19:47,440
program or this free little course

10457
05:19:47,440 --> 05:19:48,320
that's going to walk you through or

10458
05:19:48,320 --> 05:19:50,240
we've got a paid course, whatever it is,

10459
05:19:50,240 --> 05:19:51,440
that's going to take them through to the

10460
05:19:51,440 --> 05:19:52,638
stage where they're ready for use case

10461
05:19:52,638 --> 05:19:54,320
identification. And you got to start

10462
05:19:54,320 --> 05:19:55,600
thinking about it in these different

10463
05:19:55,600 --> 05:19:57,718
layers of of value that you can provide.

10464
05:19:57,718 --> 05:20:01,200
So, that's my little message for 2015.

10465
05:20:01,200 --> 05:20:03,520
Um, I'm super excited for this and I

10466
05:20:03,520 --> 05:20:05,760
can't wait to see some of you take this

10467
05:20:05,760 --> 05:20:07,600
kind of offer and just absolutely crush

10468
05:20:07,600 --> 05:20:10,160
it and and dominate niches um either

10469
05:20:10,160 --> 05:20:11,760
within your within your country or

10470
05:20:11,760 --> 05:20:13,280
internationally as well. I'm just so

10471
05:20:13,280 --> 05:20:14,480
excited because there's so much

10472
05:20:14,480 --> 05:20:16,400
potential left like we have just just

10473
05:20:16,400 --> 05:20:17,520
got started when you're seeing that

10474
05:20:17,520 --> 05:20:19,958
we're now developing the model to this

10475
05:20:19,958 --> 05:20:22,400
point and the all these companies are

10476
05:20:22,400 --> 05:20:24,320
still starting at the they're still at

10477
05:20:24,320 --> 05:20:27,200
the starting blocks. So, um I hope you

10478
05:20:27,200 --> 05:20:29,200
guys are excited for 2025. there's so

10479
05:20:29,200 --> 05:20:32,000
much opportunity and so much to be

10480
05:20:32,000 --> 05:20:36,080
gained um here monetarily but also just

10481
05:20:36,080 --> 05:20:38,718
in like self-actualization and I like

10482
05:20:38,718 --> 05:20:40,000
building something building a business

10483
05:20:40,000 --> 05:20:41,440
in the space and feeling like you've

10484
05:20:41,440 --> 05:20:42,718
achieved something feeling like you're

10485
05:20:42,718 --> 05:20:45,600
proud of yourself and I think that is as

10486
05:20:45,600 --> 05:20:46,958
much of a part of entrepreneurship as

10487
05:20:46,958 --> 05:20:48,160
just the money like once you make the

10488
05:20:48,160 --> 05:20:49,680
money you then need to find some other

10489
05:20:49,680 --> 05:20:52,560
kind of purpose so yeah this is me for

10490
05:20:52,560 --> 05:20:55,600
the year signing

10491
05:20:55,878 --> 05:20:58,320
out in this video I'll be breaking down

10492
05:20:58,320 --> 05:21:00,400
the simple change that I made in my

10493
05:21:00,400 --> 05:21:02,718
agency to allow us to scale past 10K per

10494
05:21:02,718 --> 05:21:04,480
month and how you can do the exact same

10495
05:21:04,480 --> 05:21:06,400
in yours. It's relatively easy. It's

10496
05:21:06,400 --> 05:21:07,760
just a simple tweak within the sales

10497
05:21:07,760 --> 05:21:09,760
process, but it made a complete like a

10498
05:21:09,760 --> 05:21:11,200
world of difference for us in terms of

10499
05:21:11,200 --> 05:21:12,560
our closing rates and the amount of

10500
05:21:12,560 --> 05:21:14,400
effort and and time we're putting into

10501
05:21:14,400 --> 05:21:15,440
dealing with people who are never going

10502
05:21:15,440 --> 05:21:17,600
to pay us any money anyway. So, this is

10503
05:21:17,600 --> 05:21:18,958
something that I've I talk a lot about

10504
05:21:18,958 --> 05:21:20,240
in my accelerator, but I thought I'd

10505
05:21:20,240 --> 05:21:21,760
bring it out here and do sort of a a

10506
05:21:21,760 --> 05:21:23,200
whiteboardy session on YouTube so that

10507
05:21:23,200 --> 05:21:24,560
you guys can get some of the some of the

10508
05:21:24,560 --> 05:21:25,920
source as well, cuz it's so important

10509
05:21:25,920 --> 05:21:27,440
and made such a massive difference for

10510
05:21:27,440 --> 05:21:29,520
us. So this is a a graph here showing

10511
05:21:29,520 --> 05:21:31,040
that you keep getting stuck at the 10K

10512
05:21:31,040 --> 05:21:33,200
per month mark. Um a bunch of reasons

10513
05:21:33,200 --> 05:21:34,878
why this can happen but uh I want to

10514
05:21:34,878 --> 05:21:37,040
break things down a little bit more

10515
05:21:37,040 --> 05:21:38,560
granularly first. So first thing first

10516
05:21:38,560 --> 05:21:40,878
let me illustrate this and how I came

10517
05:21:40,878 --> 05:21:42,320
across it and how we made this discovery

10518
05:21:42,320 --> 05:21:44,480
at my agency with a bit of a story. So

10519
05:21:44,480 --> 05:21:47,280
back in middle of 2023

10520
05:21:47,280 --> 05:21:48,718
uh middle of middle of last year when

10521
05:21:48,718 --> 05:21:50,718
the AI automation agency boom was going

10522
05:21:50,718 --> 05:21:52,718
crazy. I just started talking about it a

10523
05:21:52,718 --> 05:21:54,638
few months earlier and suddenly everyone

10524
05:21:54,638 --> 05:21:56,000
was talking about it and it was the

10525
05:21:56,000 --> 05:21:57,440
hottest thing in online business at the

10526
05:21:57,440 --> 05:21:59,280
time. Um, and there's so much attention.

10527
05:21:59,280 --> 05:22:01,040
I can probably draw the the graph from

10528
05:22:01,040 --> 05:22:02,360
the last video if you guys remember

10529
05:22:02,360 --> 05:22:05,200
that. Um, but the Google trends for AI

10530
05:22:05,200 --> 05:22:07,040
automation agency had this massive spike

10531
05:22:07,040 --> 05:22:09,120
and then it sort of flattened out to

10532
05:22:09,120 --> 05:22:11,040
where we kind of are now. But at this

10533
05:22:11,040 --> 05:22:13,440
point, Morning Side and my agency, we

10534
05:22:13,440 --> 05:22:15,760
were getting about 20 20 leads per day,

10535
05:22:15,760 --> 05:22:17,600
inbound leads per day via our contact

10536
05:22:17,600 --> 05:22:20,320
form on our website. So, we had so much

10537
05:22:20,320 --> 05:22:21,920
attention and so many people who wanted

10538
05:22:21,920 --> 05:22:24,638
to work with us um that our sales

10539
05:22:24,638 --> 05:22:26,240
process and our sales pipeline really

10540
05:22:26,240 --> 05:22:28,320
started to get choked up and it really

10541
05:22:28,320 --> 05:22:30,240
pointed out the the main issue that we

10542
05:22:30,240 --> 05:22:32,320
were facing which is a low close rate

10543
05:22:32,320 --> 05:22:34,000
despite all of that attention. Right?

10544
05:22:34,000 --> 05:22:37,638
So, we were getting these 20

10545
05:22:37,638 --> 05:22:41,160
leads, 20 leads per day,

10546
05:22:41,160 --> 05:22:43,680
LPD. But when you looked at our actual

10547
05:22:43,680 --> 05:22:45,920
close rate and the amount of people were

10548
05:22:45,920 --> 05:22:47,360
and businesses were converting into

10549
05:22:47,360 --> 05:22:49,920
paying clients, like 20 per day, that

10550
05:22:49,920 --> 05:22:53,280
might result in like one client. And

10551
05:22:53,280 --> 05:22:55,200
now, that's a shocking that's a shocking

10552
05:22:55,200 --> 05:22:56,958
close rate. And uh we we realized that

10553
05:22:56,958 --> 05:22:58,798
pretty quickly. We said, "Wow, this is a

10554
05:22:58,798 --> 05:23:00,240
really terrible conversion rate for the

10555
05:23:00,240 --> 05:23:01,760
amount of attention we're getting." Um,

10556
05:23:01,760 --> 05:23:05,280
but we realized that we were doing a few

10557
05:23:05,280 --> 05:23:07,360
things wrong in in our sales process.

10558
05:23:07,360 --> 05:23:08,798
And there was a few things that we

10559
05:23:08,798 --> 05:23:10,320
tested and and played around with to try

10560
05:23:10,320 --> 05:23:12,160
to fix that. And what I'm about to break

10561
05:23:12,160 --> 05:23:13,958
down is is the one that we settled on.

10562
05:23:13,958 --> 05:23:16,798
So the the sales process that we had at

10563
05:23:16,798 --> 05:23:21,240
the time was an email would come

10564
05:23:21,240 --> 05:23:24,400
in from our uh our contact form

10565
05:23:24,400 --> 05:23:26,160
submission. So the email would come in.

10566
05:23:26,160 --> 05:23:28,920
It would have information like um

10567
05:23:28,920 --> 05:23:32,120
name um

10568
05:23:32,120 --> 05:23:34,120
budget,

10569
05:23:34,120 --> 05:23:37,280
description of the project. And then on

10570
05:23:37,280 --> 05:23:38,638
that alone, my business partner Josh

10571
05:23:38,638 --> 05:23:40,480
would go in and just evaluate some of

10572
05:23:40,480 --> 05:23:42,160
those emails and go yes, no, yes, no,

10573
05:23:42,160 --> 05:23:43,520
delete them if they're not interested

10574
05:23:43,520 --> 05:23:45,680
interesting for us. Um but then if they

10575
05:23:45,680 --> 05:23:47,360
were kind of a good prospect, a good

10576
05:23:47,360 --> 05:23:49,360
lead, we would then send them a

10577
05:23:49,360 --> 05:23:51,040
discovery call link. So then they'd book

10578
05:23:51,040 --> 05:23:54,520
a Oh, can I do it?

10579
05:23:54,520 --> 05:23:56,878
Oh, and they book in a discovery call

10580
05:23:56,878 --> 05:23:59,280
with us and then we'd have a 30 minute

10581
05:23:59,280 --> 05:24:00,600
discovery call with

10582
05:24:00,600 --> 05:24:02,600
them 30

10583
05:24:02,600 --> 05:24:06,718
minutes and then from there let me go

10584
05:24:06,718 --> 05:24:08,320
you realize how complex this thing was

10585
05:24:08,320 --> 05:24:10,560
at the time. Um and from there then we'd

10586
05:24:10,560 --> 05:24:13,280
need to go to my my CTO Spencer. He

10587
05:24:13,280 --> 05:24:14,080
would have been on most of those

10588
05:24:14,080 --> 05:24:15,920
discovery calls and then he would need

10589
05:24:15,920 --> 05:24:18,080
to analyze how we can how we can build

10590
05:24:18,080 --> 05:24:19,920
that project. Right? So he needs to go

10591
05:24:19,920 --> 05:24:22,000
and and do a full analysis of okay, this

10592
05:24:22,000 --> 05:24:23,440
is what the client this is what the the

10593
05:24:23,440 --> 05:24:25,040
lead wants. This is how we're going to

10594
05:24:25,040 --> 05:24:27,760
approach it. This is the opening stage

10595
05:24:27,760 --> 05:24:29,200
of the project. This is the middle. This

10596
05:24:29,200 --> 05:24:30,878
is the end. This is the amount of hours

10597
05:24:30,878 --> 05:24:31,920
that are going to be for each of them.

10598
05:24:31,920 --> 05:24:34,878
And then we could go back to them. Um we

10599
05:24:34,878 --> 05:24:37,280
can do sort of a a calculator here.

10600
05:24:37,280 --> 05:24:38,920
Let's do a bit of a

10601
05:24:38,920 --> 05:24:40,958
calculator. We needed to calculate how

10602
05:24:40,958 --> 05:24:42,240
many hours it was going to take to do

10603
05:24:42,240 --> 05:24:44,878
that. And then we'd create a full

10604
05:24:44,878 --> 05:24:46,638
proposal. I'm changing colors here. Then

10605
05:24:46,638 --> 05:24:49,920
we need to do a full proposal with like

10606
05:24:49,920 --> 05:24:52,638
all of the the jazz on it which is okay

10607
05:24:52,638 --> 05:24:54,160
this is the this is how much the stage

10608
05:24:54,160 --> 05:24:55,280
of the project's going to cost. This is

10609
05:24:55,280 --> 05:24:57,680
the final scope. This is the cost etc.

10610
05:24:57,680 --> 05:25:00,240
This would take I don't know like three

10611
05:25:00,240 --> 05:25:02,878
three plus

10612
05:25:03,160 --> 05:25:07,280
hours. I'm running out of pen here.

10613
05:25:07,280 --> 05:25:08,638
But this whole process here of getting

10614
05:25:08,638 --> 05:25:10,718
on discovery call 30 minutes taking that

10615
05:25:10,718 --> 05:25:12,320
going to Spencer and say hey Spencer can

10616
05:25:12,320 --> 05:25:14,000
you come up with can you figure out how

10617
05:25:14,000 --> 05:25:15,680
we'd approach this build um and

10618
05:25:15,680 --> 05:25:17,600
determine if if how many hours it's

10619
05:25:17,600 --> 05:25:19,360
going to take then that information

10620
05:25:19,360 --> 05:25:20,638
would need to go to my business partner

10621
05:25:20,638 --> 05:25:22,400
Josh and he'd create this from a

10622
05:25:22,400 --> 05:25:24,160
template all be it but then he'd have to

10623
05:25:24,160 --> 05:25:25,920
create a proposal saying this is how

10624
05:25:25,920 --> 05:25:27,120
we're going to do it this is how much it

10625
05:25:27,120 --> 05:25:29,280
costs and then we need to book in

10626
05:25:29,280 --> 05:25:31,600
another

10627
05:25:32,280 --> 05:25:34,320
call I'm getting pretty good at drawing

10628
05:25:34,320 --> 05:25:35,560
these phones

10629
05:25:35,560 --> 05:25:38,958
now need to book in another call and

10630
05:25:38,958 --> 05:25:40,878
that's going to be a proposal call where

10631
05:25:40,878 --> 05:25:46,320
it might be 30 minutes to 1 hour and now

10632
05:25:46,320 --> 05:25:47,680
look at all this time we're taking just

10633
05:25:47,680 --> 05:25:49,360
to get out get to the point of proposal.

10634
05:25:49,360 --> 05:25:50,878
Then on that call they'll either say

10635
05:25:50,878 --> 05:25:52,680
sort of yes or no or make a verbal

10636
05:25:52,680 --> 05:25:55,120
agreement and if at the end of the call

10637
05:25:55,120 --> 05:25:58,000
they say yeah yeah sure sounds good. We

10638
05:25:58,000 --> 05:25:59,840
found that there was a massive drop off

10639
05:25:59,840 --> 05:26:01,360
between the people who we actually pres

10640
05:26:01,360 --> 05:26:03,520
presented proposals to and the number of

10641
05:26:03,520 --> 05:26:05,280
people who actually ended up signing and

10642
05:26:05,280 --> 05:26:07,200
and paying us an invoice. All right. So,

10643
05:26:07,200 --> 05:26:10,160
this drop off between proposal and and

10644
05:26:10,160 --> 05:26:13,760
actually uh how can I draw this? Make

10645
05:26:13,760 --> 05:26:15,160
this

10646
05:26:15,160 --> 05:26:17,600
a we skip a couple steps in here like

10647
05:26:17,600 --> 05:26:19,360
sending the contract, going back and

10648
05:26:19,360 --> 05:26:21,520
forth on the contract, you would go back

10649
05:26:21,520 --> 05:26:24,320
and forth and back and forth um flopping

10650
05:26:24,320 --> 05:26:25,840
around and then by the time you've gone

10651
05:26:25,840 --> 05:26:27,600
back and forth with the contract three

10652
05:26:27,600 --> 05:26:29,920
or four times, then they're like

10653
05:26:29,920 --> 05:26:31,760
suddenly not as interested in the in the

10654
05:26:31,760 --> 05:26:33,520
project anymore. They've lost the buzz.

10655
05:26:33,520 --> 05:26:34,798
uh you really need to get as quickly

10656
05:26:34,798 --> 05:26:36,320
from this point of saying, "Hey, I'm

10657
05:26:36,320 --> 05:26:37,920
interested. I want to work with you."

10658
05:26:37,920 --> 05:26:39,600
And and getting them signed as fast as

10659
05:26:39,600 --> 05:26:41,360
possible because in here, anything could

10660
05:26:41,360 --> 05:26:43,040
happen. They could something in their

10661
05:26:43,040 --> 05:26:44,240
business could blow up. Suddenly they're

10662
05:26:44,240 --> 05:26:45,520
not interested in AI anymore. They read

10663
05:26:45,520 --> 05:26:47,440
an article and they're scared of it. All

10664
05:26:47,440 --> 05:26:49,200
sorts of crap. So the longer this was,

10665
05:26:49,200 --> 05:26:50,878
the the higher the drop off we saw here.

10666
05:26:50,878 --> 05:26:52,240
But the really the key drop off point

10667
05:26:52,240 --> 05:26:54,240
was this proposal here cuz they go from

10668
05:26:54,240 --> 05:26:56,160
someone who's filled out a form, don't

10669
05:26:56,160 --> 05:26:57,920
have really any idea how much this is

10670
05:26:57,920 --> 05:26:59,680
going to cost them. We go through all

10671
05:26:59,680 --> 05:27:02,320
this time and we invest all this time

10672
05:27:02,320 --> 05:27:04,798
here in calculating, calling, writing

10673
05:27:04,798 --> 05:27:06,160
the proposal, then we get on the call

10674
05:27:06,160 --> 05:27:08,878
and present it. And a lot of the times

10675
05:27:08,878 --> 05:27:10,878
like this stuff a stuff isn't cheap. If

10676
05:27:10,878 --> 05:27:12,080
you have a development team like me and

10677
05:27:12,080 --> 05:27:13,680
our developers cost quite a lot of money

10678
05:27:13,680 --> 05:27:15,840
per hour. We have to mark our services

10679
05:27:15,840 --> 05:27:18,160
up significantly. It's it's like very

10680
05:27:18,160 --> 05:27:20,080
expensive projects a lot of the time.

10681
05:27:20,080 --> 05:27:22,638
And when you then present that to them,

10682
05:27:22,638 --> 05:27:24,320
they aren't are nowhere near ready for

10683
05:27:24,320 --> 05:27:26,160
that kind of price point. Well, in in

10684
05:27:26,160 --> 05:27:28,320
most cases. So, it's really an issue of

10685
05:27:28,320 --> 05:27:31,120
the lead quality and we weren't checking

10686
05:27:31,120 --> 05:27:33,040
or or sort of price testing them

10687
05:27:33,040 --> 05:27:34,878
beforehand and we're wasting all this

10688
05:27:34,878 --> 05:27:36,080
time and getting to this point at the

10689
05:27:36,080 --> 05:27:37,920
end where we've we've pitched them and

10690
05:27:37,920 --> 05:27:39,440
then they look at it and they go, "Oh, w

10691
05:27:39,440 --> 05:27:42,240
like um no chance no chance I'm paying

10692
05:27:42,240 --> 05:27:43,360
that." And they go, "That's way too

10693
05:27:43,360 --> 05:27:44,798
expensive for what I'm looking for.

10694
05:27:44,798 --> 05:27:46,558
Thank you. Have a nice day." And so we

10695
05:27:46,558 --> 05:27:47,878
got this big drop

10696
05:27:47,878 --> 05:27:50,958
off where you might get I don't know you

10697
05:27:50,958 --> 05:27:54,000
make six proposals and get like one of

10698
05:27:54,000 --> 05:27:55,600
these guys coming out the other end and

10699
05:27:55,600 --> 05:27:56,718
they're actually interested in signing

10700
05:27:56,718 --> 05:27:59,120
for the for the project. So looking at

10701
05:27:59,120 --> 05:28:01,600
this we realized we are spending so much

10702
05:28:01,600 --> 05:28:03,920
time on this step here of hopping

10703
05:28:03,920 --> 05:28:05,920
hopping on calls with basically everyone

10704
05:28:05,920 --> 05:28:08,160
and then allowing these tire kickers let

10705
05:28:08,160 --> 05:28:11,280
me draw a tire. tire kickers are all

10706
05:28:11,280 --> 05:28:13,040
over the AI space that business owners

10707
05:28:13,040 --> 05:28:14,638
who are interested these early adopters

10708
05:28:14,638 --> 05:28:17,040
if you remember the tech adoption curve

10709
05:28:17,040 --> 05:28:18,878
we're in this early adopter phase we're

10710
05:28:18,878 --> 05:28:20,160
getting a lot of early adopters

10711
05:28:20,160 --> 05:28:21,840
especially earlier on in in my journey

10712
05:28:21,840 --> 05:28:23,280
last year in the first sort of 6 months

10713
05:28:23,280 --> 05:28:25,280
of starting my agency we were getting a

10714
05:28:25,280 --> 05:28:26,558
lot of these early adopters who didn't

10715
05:28:26,558 --> 05:28:28,400
really care much about the the

10716
05:28:28,400 --> 05:28:30,000
functionality of it just wanted to feel

10717
05:28:30,000 --> 05:28:31,920
like they're building something cool and

10718
05:28:31,920 --> 05:28:33,360
and being on the front foot with their

10719
05:28:33,360 --> 05:28:36,718
business so these guys do tend to be tie

10720
05:28:36,718 --> 05:28:38,480
kickers they because they aren't seeking

10721
05:28:38,480 --> 05:28:41,958
some really really businessch changing

10722
05:28:41,958 --> 05:28:44,400
implementation, the the rate of them

10723
05:28:44,400 --> 05:28:45,840
being tie kickers and just kind of

10724
05:28:45,840 --> 05:28:47,440
wanting to to hop on calls and learn

10725
05:28:47,440 --> 05:28:49,120
more and feel like they're in the space

10726
05:28:49,120 --> 05:28:51,200
is is much higher. So tie kickers,

10727
05:28:51,200 --> 05:28:52,718
they're just coming in and we're

10728
05:28:52,718 --> 05:28:55,040
spending all of this time 30 minutes and

10729
05:28:55,040 --> 05:28:57,120
then Spencer is having to do uh I don't

10730
05:28:57,120 --> 05:28:59,040
know maybe like 1 to 2 hours here and

10731
05:28:59,040 --> 05:29:00,638
then Josh has to put 3 hours in here and

10732
05:29:00,638 --> 05:29:02,480
then we have to put Spencer and Josh on

10733
05:29:02,480 --> 05:29:04,240
this call for a 30 minute to an hour

10734
05:29:04,240 --> 05:29:06,878
call. so much time just to find out are

10735
05:29:06,878 --> 05:29:09,280
they or are they not a tire kicker? And

10736
05:29:09,280 --> 05:29:12,320
so what we did to change this is I mean

10737
05:29:12,320 --> 05:29:13,760
it it was kind of like a Hail Mary. We

10738
05:29:13,760 --> 05:29:15,600
were just saying look these close rates

10739
05:29:15,600 --> 05:29:17,760
are so awful there has to something has

10740
05:29:17,760 --> 05:29:20,000
to change. Let's just like [ __ ] it.

10741
05:29:20,000 --> 05:29:21,600
Let's just let's just throw a a low

10742
05:29:21,600 --> 05:29:23,040
ticket offer at them to get them started

10743
05:29:23,040 --> 05:29:25,080
and and see who gets through. So what we

10744
05:29:25,080 --> 05:29:28,240
did is implemented what we now call an

10745
05:29:28,240 --> 05:29:30,240
exploration milestone. And this this may

10746
05:29:30,240 --> 05:29:32,958
be standard for uh development companies

10747
05:29:32,958 --> 05:29:35,680
all over the show, but um until about a

10748
05:29:35,680 --> 05:29:37,360
year ago, I wasn't some development

10749
05:29:37,360 --> 05:29:40,080
company CEO as many of you guys won't

10750
05:29:40,080 --> 05:29:42,400
be. So, we were definitely learning this

10751
05:29:42,400 --> 05:29:44,000
as as people who've just been online

10752
05:29:44,000 --> 05:29:46,558
business entrepreneurs and having to

10753
05:29:46,558 --> 05:29:48,080
pick up how to run these development

10754
05:29:48,080 --> 05:29:51,120
companies. Um there's there's nuance to

10755
05:29:51,120 --> 05:29:53,400
to the the sales process as you can

10756
05:29:53,400 --> 05:29:55,920
imagine. So, we tried this thing. We'll

10757
05:29:55,920 --> 05:29:58,638
call it an exploration milestone. And if

10758
05:29:58,638 --> 05:30:01,760
I rewrite this this flow, uh the email

10759
05:30:01,760 --> 05:30:03,718
still came

10760
05:30:03,718 --> 05:30:06,878
in. Uh we still approved or disproved it

10761
05:30:06,878 --> 05:30:09,520
and then disproved it, declined. Uh and

10762
05:30:09,520 --> 05:30:11,920
if it was good, we probably have a thing

10763
05:30:11,920 --> 05:30:13,600
here where it's like, eh, we don't want

10764
05:30:13,600 --> 05:30:15,280
to work with them. We book in the

10765
05:30:15,280 --> 05:30:17,680
discovery

10766
05:30:17,958 --> 05:30:20,240
call and that's going to still be 30

10767
05:30:20,240 --> 05:30:23,240
minutes.

10768
05:30:24,480 --> 05:30:26,160
But then at the end of the discovery

10769
05:30:26,160 --> 05:30:28,000
call, if we've qualified them and vetted

10770
05:30:28,000 --> 05:30:29,200
them out properly and that they seem

10771
05:30:29,200 --> 05:30:30,878
like a good client, there's a like when

10772
05:30:30,878 --> 05:30:32,718
we get we get so many leads coming to us

10773
05:30:32,718 --> 05:30:34,240
that we can be quite picky about who we

10774
05:30:34,240 --> 05:30:35,920
work with because there's nothing worse

10775
05:30:35,920 --> 05:30:38,718
than I mean I built my business to have

10776
05:30:38,718 --> 05:30:41,120
a income stream but also to enjoy what I

10777
05:30:41,120 --> 05:30:42,958
do. And if I'm dealing with clients who

10778
05:30:42,958 --> 05:30:45,760
are an absolute pain in the ass that is

10779
05:30:45,760 --> 05:30:47,680
working against what my goal was with my

10780
05:30:47,680 --> 05:30:49,200
business, right? I I don't want this to

10781
05:30:49,200 --> 05:30:50,958
feel like a trap and my business partner

10782
05:30:50,958 --> 05:30:52,080
and the whole team don't want to work

10783
05:30:52,080 --> 05:30:54,000
with awful people. It's so bad. It's

10784
05:30:54,000 --> 05:30:58,200
it's like multiple levels of of of of

10785
05:30:58,200 --> 05:31:01,360
badness. There's multiple levels of of

10786
05:31:01,360 --> 05:31:03,040
destruction and damage within the

10787
05:31:03,040 --> 05:31:04,878
business because not only you are

10788
05:31:04,878 --> 05:31:06,320
dealing with this this bad client, but

10789
05:31:06,320 --> 05:31:07,840
everyone in the team is. It just brings

10790
05:31:07,840 --> 05:31:09,440
it's like an anchor that that brings

10791
05:31:09,440 --> 05:31:12,558
down the whole team. Um so we get very

10792
05:31:12,558 --> 05:31:14,480
picky here. Um, and at the end of the

10793
05:31:14,480 --> 05:31:16,558
discovery call, if they have a clear

10794
05:31:16,558 --> 05:31:18,718
solution that we can solve, if they are

10795
05:31:18,718 --> 05:31:21,760
someone who we want to work with and

10796
05:31:21,760 --> 05:31:23,280
overall seems like a good potential

10797
05:31:23,280 --> 05:31:25,600
client for us, then we will at the end

10798
05:31:25,600 --> 05:31:28,120
of the call, we will transition

10799
05:31:28,120 --> 05:31:32,480
it transition it. That's a transition to

10800
05:31:32,480 --> 05:31:34,000
at the end of the call, I'll go to my

10801
05:31:34,000 --> 05:31:35,520
business partner, Josh. So, hey Josh,

10802
05:31:35,520 --> 05:31:37,120
yep, everything checks out for me here.

10803
05:31:37,120 --> 05:31:38,320
I think it's good for us to just jump

10804
05:31:38,320 --> 05:31:39,680
straight into an exploration milestone

10805
05:31:39,680 --> 05:31:42,558
uh and kick things off next week. Boom.

10806
05:31:42,558 --> 05:31:45,920
Now we've gone from just talking about,

10807
05:31:45,920 --> 05:31:48,000
hey, AI stuff is cool. Yeah, tie kick at

10808
05:31:48,000 --> 05:31:49,600
this, Tai kick at that. We're starting

10809
05:31:49,600 --> 05:31:50,958
to put the heat on them and say, hey,

10810
05:31:50,958 --> 05:31:52,480
look, we're looking, we need some money.

10811
05:31:52,480 --> 05:31:53,920
Like, you've got your free discovery

10812
05:31:53,920 --> 05:31:55,680
call. We've had a chat with you, and now

10813
05:31:55,680 --> 05:31:56,798
you're going to cough up to keep working

10814
05:31:56,798 --> 05:31:58,798
with us. Now, this does come down to

10815
05:31:58,798 --> 05:32:00,320
some degree to the brand that that

10816
05:32:00,320 --> 05:32:01,840
you've built. For me in Morningside, we

10817
05:32:01,840 --> 05:32:04,160
have a a considerable brand position as

10818
05:32:04,160 --> 05:32:06,240
a AI solutions company because of the

10819
05:32:06,240 --> 05:32:07,520
stuff that I do here, waving my hands

10820
05:32:07,520 --> 05:32:08,718
around on the camera, because it shows

10821
05:32:08,718 --> 05:32:09,680
that I know what I'm talking about,

10822
05:32:09,680 --> 05:32:10,798
right? And you want to work with people

10823
05:32:10,798 --> 05:32:11,760
who know what they're talking about,

10824
05:32:11,760 --> 05:32:13,680
which is why you should consider making

10825
05:32:13,680 --> 05:32:15,280
content either YouTube, LinkedIn,

10826
05:32:15,280 --> 05:32:18,480
whatever it is. I can't even explain. I

10827
05:32:18,480 --> 05:32:20,240
mean, we're getting 20 of these a day.

10828
05:32:20,240 --> 05:32:22,080
We still get quite a lot of them. And I

10829
05:32:22,080 --> 05:32:23,440
don't even post nearly as much as I did

10830
05:32:23,440 --> 05:32:25,280
back in the day. So, getting a little

10831
05:32:25,280 --> 05:32:29,120
bit off track, but then we say explo

10832
05:32:29,120 --> 05:32:31,440
exploration milestone. That's what we're

10833
05:32:31,440 --> 05:32:33,120
looking to do. We end the call and

10834
05:32:33,120 --> 05:32:34,400
straight after the call, well, we get

10835
05:32:34,400 --> 05:32:35,760
them to agree to it and we say, "Yeah,

10836
05:32:35,760 --> 05:32:37,280
well, if if you're happy, we can we can

10837
05:32:37,280 --> 05:32:38,400
start what we call an exploration

10838
05:32:38,400 --> 05:32:39,360
milestone." They might ask some

10839
05:32:39,360 --> 05:32:40,400
questions say, "Well, that's when we

10840
05:32:40,400 --> 05:32:42,638
just uh go in and we do a very quick

10841
05:32:42,638 --> 05:32:44,798
sort of prototyping, scoping, specking,

10842
05:32:44,798 --> 05:32:46,638
determining how much this is going to

10843
05:32:46,638 --> 05:32:48,080
cost for you. We can't give you an

10844
05:32:48,080 --> 05:32:49,440
accurate quote on the whole project

10845
05:32:49,440 --> 05:32:50,638
until we've gone in and done some

10846
05:32:50,638 --> 05:32:52,718
exploration and done some tests cuz we

10847
05:32:52,718 --> 05:32:55,040
need to actually cuz the clients will

10848
05:32:55,040 --> 05:32:56,400
want certain kinds of outputs from the

10849
05:32:56,400 --> 05:32:57,520
system and because we're going to get

10850
05:32:57,520 --> 05:32:59,120
into this in a second, which is a really

10851
05:32:59,120 --> 05:33:00,240
cool part of this video. So, stick

10852
05:33:00,240 --> 05:33:02,400
around. Um, but clients want specific

10853
05:33:02,400 --> 05:33:04,080
outputs from their systems as as anyone

10854
05:33:04,080 --> 05:33:06,400
would. And if we aren't able to get

10855
05:33:06,400 --> 05:33:08,718
those kind of outputs, then we shouldn't

10856
05:33:08,718 --> 05:33:09,680
take on the project. Right? So

10857
05:33:09,680 --> 05:33:11,600
exploration is kind of saving your ass

10858
05:33:11,600 --> 05:33:13,280
and also making sure the client and

10859
05:33:13,280 --> 05:33:15,200
expectations are managed correctly

10860
05:33:15,200 --> 05:33:17,040
because you get a chance to go, okay,

10861
05:33:17,040 --> 05:33:19,040
let's very quickly spit up a prototype

10862
05:33:19,040 --> 05:33:21,600
for okay, pass me your data, Mr. Client,

10863
05:33:21,600 --> 05:33:23,520
and let me give me some examples of

10864
05:33:23,520 --> 05:33:25,280
input and output pairs and and responses

10865
05:33:25,280 --> 05:33:26,718
that you want from it. Okay, I'm going

10866
05:33:26,718 --> 05:33:28,480
to take those in, give my to my dev

10867
05:33:28,480 --> 05:33:30,080
team, and they can whip it up quickly,

10868
05:33:30,080 --> 05:33:31,920
sort of determine if we can get kind of

10869
05:33:31,920 --> 05:33:32,958
close to the outputs they're looking

10870
05:33:32,958 --> 05:33:34,958
for. If we can, great. Yep, that system

10871
05:33:34,958 --> 05:33:36,558
works to some degree. Now we're good to

10872
05:33:36,558 --> 05:33:37,920
take on the full project and we can be

10873
05:33:37,920 --> 05:33:39,360
confident that we can charge you x

10874
05:33:39,360 --> 05:33:40,638
amount of dollars and it's going to come

10875
05:33:40,638 --> 05:33:43,040
within this time frame. So it's really

10876
05:33:43,040 --> 05:33:44,878
such a key thing and mass like an

10877
05:33:44,878 --> 05:33:46,000
absolute game changanger for our

10878
05:33:46,000 --> 05:33:48,718
business. Um, so how do we go from here?

10879
05:33:48,718 --> 05:33:51,920
Expiration milestone. Uh, we send that

10880
05:33:51,920 --> 05:33:54,080
via email. So we'll send a templated

10881
05:33:54,080 --> 05:33:55,680
contract. We send an email just saying,

10882
05:33:55,680 --> 05:33:57,920
"Hey, just following up on, uh, on on

10883
05:33:57,920 --> 05:34:00,000
the call you we just had um that the

10884
05:34:00,000 --> 05:34:01,600
expiration milestone is going to cost X

10885
05:34:01,600 --> 05:34:04,480
amount." And we started off with ours at

10886
05:34:04,480 --> 05:34:07,520
uh $800 and that would be sort of a 3 to

10887
05:34:07,520 --> 05:34:10,958
5 day exploration and on a usually more

10888
05:34:10,958 --> 05:34:12,480
it usually ended up sort of closer to

10889
05:34:12,480 --> 05:34:14,718
five than three. Um but the $800

10890
05:34:14,718 --> 05:34:16,080
expiration was a good price point that

10891
05:34:16,080 --> 05:34:17,600
we found people would be interested in

10892
05:34:17,600 --> 05:34:19,200
and and they took the bait they took the

10893
05:34:19,200 --> 05:34:21,680
offer pretty often. So right here you're

10894
05:34:21,680 --> 05:34:23,718
asking them to cough up and you're

10895
05:34:23,718 --> 05:34:26,798
saying sorry buddy no more tire kickers

10896
05:34:26,798 --> 05:34:28,400
beyond here. you are not going to get a

10897
05:34:28,400 --> 05:34:30,718
single second more of my time until

10898
05:34:30,718 --> 05:34:32,240
you've given me money to compensate me

10899
05:34:32,240 --> 05:34:34,558
and my team which allowed us to then

10900
05:34:34,558 --> 05:34:36,718
only make presentations to clients who

10901
05:34:36,718 --> 05:34:38,160
are actually qualified to some degree

10902
05:34:38,160 --> 05:34:40,400
financially qualified. Um so by bringing

10903
05:34:40,400 --> 05:34:43,280
the price uh the time that they had to

10904
05:34:43,280 --> 05:34:46,878
cough up some money from way down here

10905
05:34:46,878 --> 05:34:49,120
to up here we had just saved ourselves

10906
05:34:49,120 --> 05:34:51,760
all this time and that that was a

10907
05:34:51,760 --> 05:34:53,280
absolute game changer for us. my

10908
05:34:53,280 --> 05:34:54,558
business partner Josh instead of working

10909
05:34:54,558 --> 05:34:56,878
on it being on the sales call hamster

10910
05:34:56,878 --> 05:34:59,040
wheel of proposals we'd go through these

10911
05:34:59,040 --> 05:35:01,040
cycles of oh yeah cool there's this big

10912
05:35:01,040 --> 05:35:03,200
client in the pipeline who w and then

10913
05:35:03,200 --> 05:35:04,958
next week yeah they didn't reply to the

10914
05:35:04,958 --> 05:35:07,440
proposal so it happens to it happens to

10915
05:35:07,440 --> 05:35:08,878
me it'll happen to you but you can do

10916
05:35:08,878 --> 05:35:11,680
things with your sales process to try to

10917
05:35:11,680 --> 05:35:13,600
split split the whiff the wheat from the

10918
05:35:13,600 --> 05:35:15,440
chaff a little bit sooner so you want

10919
05:35:15,440 --> 05:35:16,958
the you want the good guys to make it

10920
05:35:16,958 --> 05:35:18,160
past here you want to give them a chance

10921
05:35:18,160 --> 05:35:20,080
to show that they are serious and this

10922
05:35:20,080 --> 05:35:22,240
this amount is is a good way of doing it

10923
05:35:22,240 --> 05:35:24,240
Now, for full transparency, we now

10924
05:35:24,240 --> 05:35:27,160
charge most recent one we did was

10925
05:35:27,160 --> 05:35:29,680
$2,000. Um, we've actually charged right

10926
05:35:29,680 --> 05:35:31,760
up to $5,000. Now, that may sound

10927
05:35:31,760 --> 05:35:34,160
ludicrous, but when we do $100,000

10928
05:35:34,160 --> 05:35:37,520
deals, $5,000 expiration uh in order to

10929
05:35:37,520 --> 05:35:38,718
scope it all out. There's a lot of work

10930
05:35:38,718 --> 05:35:40,000
involved for us, but the client would

10931
05:35:40,000 --> 05:35:41,840
rather pay 5 grand up front and

10932
05:35:41,840 --> 05:35:43,920
determine, hey, is this feasible? Uh

10933
05:35:43,920 --> 05:35:45,600
what kind of what's the actual budget

10934
05:35:45,600 --> 05:35:47,120
going to be at the end of the day? And

10935
05:35:47,120 --> 05:35:48,878
and are these kind of systems actually

10936
05:35:48,878 --> 05:35:50,718
something that are a good match for my

10937
05:35:50,718 --> 05:35:54,718
use case? So you can charge up to $2,000

10938
05:35:54,718 --> 05:35:57,040
$5,000 for the expirations that take

10939
05:35:57,040 --> 05:36:00,280
these these do take sort of 2 to 3 weeks

10940
05:36:00,280 --> 05:36:02,638
though. Uh just being fully transparent.

10941
05:36:02,638 --> 05:36:05,440
So it's not like it was a 3day and 3day.

10942
05:36:05,440 --> 05:36:08,920
These are definitely big boys for bigger

10943
05:36:08,920 --> 05:36:12,160
projects. And then expiration milestone,

10944
05:36:12,160 --> 05:36:13,520
you send that off via email. Say, "Hey,

10945
05:36:13,520 --> 05:36:15,440
look, it's going to cost 2 grand or in

10946
05:36:15,440 --> 05:36:17,440
your case might be $800 to start. It's

10947
05:36:17,440 --> 05:36:19,040
going to cost $800. uh let me know if

10948
05:36:19,040 --> 05:36:20,798
that's all good and I can send over my

10949
05:36:20,798 --> 05:36:22,320
we can send over a templated contract.

10950
05:36:22,320 --> 05:36:23,920
You just change a couple little things.

10951
05:36:23,920 --> 05:36:25,120
Uh and once they've signed that, you

10952
05:36:25,120 --> 05:36:26,400
send the send the invoice with the

10953
05:36:26,400 --> 05:36:28,400
contract as well. Once it's all paid,

10954
05:36:28,400 --> 05:36:33,280
then you go sweet straight into

10955
05:36:33,878 --> 05:36:37,638
Slack. And then you go, hey,

10956
05:36:37,638 --> 05:36:41,638
send requirements.

10957
05:36:43,280 --> 05:36:44,798
And that's when you ask them, okay, in

10958
05:36:44,798 --> 05:36:47,760
order to do our our expiration, actually

10959
05:36:47,760 --> 05:36:49,040
I missed the best part of this whole

10960
05:36:49,040 --> 05:36:50,320
thing. Let me go back a step. This is

10961
05:36:50,320 --> 05:36:53,080
when it gets real saucy.

10962
05:36:53,080 --> 05:36:56,638
So, not only does expiration give us a

10963
05:36:56,638 --> 05:37:00,160
chance to weed out the the guys from the

10964
05:37:00,160 --> 05:37:02,558
split the wheat from the CHF, we also

10965
05:37:02,558 --> 05:37:04,958
get an opportunity to set expectations

10966
05:37:04,958 --> 05:37:07,798
with our clients. And AI systems are

10967
05:37:07,798 --> 05:37:10,878
inherently random and hard to predict.

10968
05:37:10,878 --> 05:37:12,718
They are non-deterministic by nature

10969
05:37:12,718 --> 05:37:14,958
which means that the same input can

10970
05:37:14,958 --> 05:37:16,480
create different outputs and this is due

10971
05:37:16,480 --> 05:37:18,320
to the sort of randomization of the next

10972
05:37:18,320 --> 05:37:21,680
token generation. We are trying to give

10973
05:37:21,680 --> 05:37:24,320
in in many cases reliable and

10974
05:37:24,320 --> 05:37:26,480
predictable outcomes with technology

10975
05:37:26,480 --> 05:37:28,958
that on the most fun most fundamental

10976
05:37:28,958 --> 05:37:31,360
like foundational level is random and

10977
05:37:31,360 --> 05:37:35,200
and tries to be random. So in order to

10978
05:37:35,200 --> 05:37:37,360
solve uh in order to get client

10979
05:37:37,360 --> 05:37:39,360
satisfaction and set expectations right,

10980
05:37:39,360 --> 05:37:42,320
we have also had to deal with uh let me

10981
05:37:42,320 --> 05:37:43,440
let me give you an example actually this

10982
05:37:43,440 --> 05:37:45,120
is a better way to do it. This may sound

10983
05:37:45,120 --> 05:37:48,760
familiar. So client

10984
05:37:49,958 --> 05:37:52,958
uh client uh you say you're building

10985
05:37:52,958 --> 05:37:54,798
some kind of chatbased system for them.

10986
05:37:54,798 --> 05:37:58,920
client uh

10987
05:37:58,920 --> 05:38:02,200
doesn't like

10988
05:38:02,200 --> 05:38:04,160
output. Say that you're building a

10989
05:38:04,160 --> 05:38:05,680
system, a chatbot for them and they say,

10990
05:38:05,680 --> 05:38:06,958
"Oh, I don't I didn't like the way that

10991
05:38:06,958 --> 05:38:09,680
it says that." And you say, "Okay, well,

10992
05:38:09,680 --> 05:38:12,160
they

10993
05:38:12,680 --> 05:38:16,120
provide ideal

10994
05:38:16,120 --> 05:38:18,480
output." And you go, "Okay, well, I'll

10995
05:38:18,480 --> 05:38:20,160
I'll tune the system to try to get it to

10996
05:38:20,160 --> 05:38:24,958
output output that kind of output." And

10997
05:38:33,240 --> 05:38:36,360
then it outputs the correct

10998
05:38:36,360 --> 05:38:42,600
one. Maybe four out of five times.

10999
05:38:43,920 --> 05:38:46,717
client gets

11000
05:38:49,480 --> 05:38:53,920
mad because it's not always

11001
05:38:59,240 --> 05:39:01,840
consistent. Now, this this four out of

11002
05:39:01,840 --> 05:39:03,840
five times, the the other time, the one

11003
05:39:03,840 --> 05:39:05,040
out of five times that it doesn't say

11004
05:39:05,040 --> 05:39:07,680
it, it might just slightly reward it.

11005
05:39:07,680 --> 05:39:09,280
But this client is looking for exact

11006
05:39:09,280 --> 05:39:11,920
outputs and you're trying to he wants

11007
05:39:11,920 --> 05:39:13,360
exact outputs. For you to get the money

11008
05:39:13,360 --> 05:39:15,360
from them and finish the contract, you

11009
05:39:15,360 --> 05:39:16,958
need to give them this five out of five

11010
05:39:16,958 --> 05:39:18,958
perfect exact same outputs every time.

11011
05:39:18,958 --> 05:39:20,400
When in reality, the system is putting

11012
05:39:20,400 --> 05:39:22,480
out one and five times something that is

11013
05:39:22,480 --> 05:39:25,280
a slight modification of it's still

11014
05:39:25,280 --> 05:39:26,798
saying the same thing. It still means

11015
05:39:26,798 --> 05:39:28,160
the same, but it's a slightly different

11016
05:39:28,160 --> 05:39:31,400
wording. And this client goes,

11017
05:39:31,400 --> 05:39:33,840
eh, client gets mad because it's not

11018
05:39:33,840 --> 05:39:35,360
consistent.

11019
05:39:35,360 --> 05:39:38,320
um demands

11020
05:39:39,798 --> 05:39:42,798
refund

11021
05:39:44,760 --> 05:39:47,160
because

11022
05:39:47,160 --> 05:39:49,080
I

11023
05:39:49,080 --> 05:39:55,920
don't like the way it talks.

11024
05:39:55,920 --> 05:39:59,920
So here you have a feeling I don't like

11025
05:39:59,920 --> 05:40:01,760
the the way that the client feels about

11026
05:40:01,760 --> 05:40:03,520
the outputs is now determining whether

11027
05:40:03,520 --> 05:40:06,320
or not you get your money which is a a

11028
05:40:06,320 --> 05:40:09,280
bad place to be. So we have tried to

11029
05:40:09,280 --> 05:40:10,798
solve this problem in a number of ways

11030
05:40:10,798 --> 05:40:12,400
and eventually in combination with the

11031
05:40:12,400 --> 05:40:14,080
exploration milestone we came up with a

11032
05:40:14,080 --> 05:40:17,040
method that solves all of this while

11033
05:40:17,040 --> 05:40:18,718
also allowing us to do the exploration

11034
05:40:18,718 --> 05:40:20,240
and solving downstream issues with

11035
05:40:20,240 --> 05:40:21,760
client satisfaction as well. So, I'll

11036
05:40:21,760 --> 05:40:23,760
now get into that cuz I know you came

11037
05:40:23,760 --> 05:40:25,440
for the sauce, but I'll uh I'll give you

11038
05:40:25,440 --> 05:40:26,440
a double

11039
05:40:26,440 --> 05:40:28,798
serving cuz you know that's how we work

11040
05:40:28,798 --> 05:40:31,080
on this

11041
05:40:31,080 --> 05:40:34,320
channel. So, the issue here is as I just

11042
05:40:34,320 --> 05:40:35,878
pointed out

11043
05:40:35,878 --> 05:40:38,200
LLMs

11044
05:40:38,200 --> 05:40:42,000
are you're dealing with two

11045
05:40:43,718 --> 05:40:46,600
problems. One

11046
05:40:46,600 --> 05:40:51,958
LLM LLM uh non

11047
05:40:54,680 --> 05:40:57,440
deterministic. They are by nature random

11048
05:40:57,440 --> 05:40:59,680
and they they spit out different outputs

11049
05:40:59,680 --> 05:41:02,480
from the same inputs. And then two,

11050
05:41:02,480 --> 05:41:05,718
you're also fighting against

11051
05:41:05,718 --> 05:41:08,440
client

11052
05:41:08,440 --> 05:41:13,717
feelings and subjective opinions.

11053
05:41:15,840 --> 05:41:17,760
Now, these two when you're trying to

11054
05:41:17,760 --> 05:41:19,680
build a business selling AI solutions,

11055
05:41:19,680 --> 05:41:22,000
these two go together like Mentos and

11056
05:41:22,000 --> 05:41:24,798
Coca-Cola, um, they they don't get

11057
05:41:24,798 --> 05:41:27,600
along. Uh, and this is a an awful

11058
05:41:27,600 --> 05:41:28,958
mixture of things to build a business

11059
05:41:28,958 --> 05:41:31,040
on. And we at Morningside realize this

11060
05:41:31,040 --> 05:41:33,520
pretty quick that, okay, well, clients

11061
05:41:33,520 --> 05:41:35,040
are going to have feelings towards if

11062
05:41:35,040 --> 05:41:36,878
we're building any kind of chatbased or

11063
05:41:36,878 --> 05:41:38,400
or even just it's it's a content

11064
05:41:38,400 --> 05:41:40,798
generator, how they feel about like, uh,

11065
05:41:40,798 --> 05:41:42,958
I don't it's not really what I like.

11066
05:41:42,958 --> 05:41:43,920
there's something about this. And

11067
05:41:43,920 --> 05:41:45,120
sometimes we get to a point where a

11068
05:41:45,120 --> 05:41:46,798
client is, "Yeah, this system's cool.

11069
05:41:46,798 --> 05:41:47,760
Yeah, yeah, it's good. It's good. It's

11070
05:41:47,760 --> 05:41:49,200
good. It's good. It's good." And then

11071
05:41:49,200 --> 05:41:51,360
the next week they'll say, "Oh, no. We

11072
05:41:51,360 --> 05:41:52,718
need a big change." Like, I just

11073
05:41:52,718 --> 05:41:54,320
suddenly don't like this anymore. And

11074
05:41:54,320 --> 05:41:56,558
you're dealing with emotions, uh,

11075
05:41:56,558 --> 05:41:58,798
emotions and opinions, and you're trying

11076
05:41:58,798 --> 05:42:00,160
to make money and have some kind of

11077
05:42:00,160 --> 05:42:03,040
consistent and predictable business. Uh,

11078
05:42:03,040 --> 05:42:05,760
but you're also now now at at the at the

11079
05:42:05,760 --> 05:42:08,878
whim of these client emotions and also

11080
05:42:08,878 --> 05:42:11,520
these inherently random systems. So,

11081
05:42:11,520 --> 05:42:13,040
these two problems, we realized pretty

11082
05:42:13,040 --> 05:42:14,320
quick that if we don't solve these at

11083
05:42:14,320 --> 05:42:15,600
Morningside, we're going to be we're

11084
05:42:15,600 --> 05:42:16,638
going to be in the [ __ ] and we're not

11085
05:42:16,638 --> 05:42:18,638
going to have much of a business. So,

11086
05:42:18,638 --> 05:42:21,760
how do we solve this? Well, my uh my

11087
05:42:21,760 --> 05:42:25,440
absolute whiz and genius of a CTO

11088
05:42:25,440 --> 05:42:27,360
uh we sort of tasked him with this and

11089
05:42:27,360 --> 05:42:29,040
said, "Hey, we need a solution to this."

11090
05:42:29,040 --> 05:42:32,958
And he came up with a now widely used

11091
05:42:32,958 --> 05:42:35,040
system. Um can I rub this off? No, I

11092
05:42:35,040 --> 05:42:37,120
still I still have a bit more to go. uh

11093
05:42:37,120 --> 05:42:40,958
that we call I it's not we didn't it's

11094
05:42:40,958 --> 05:42:42,558
been a thing but the way that we apply

11095
05:42:42,558 --> 05:42:44,878
it I believe is sort of a industry first

11096
05:42:44,878 --> 05:42:49,520
it's called co sign

11097
05:42:51,240 --> 05:42:54,000
similarity similarity so what cosine

11098
05:42:54,000 --> 05:42:56,000
similarity does is it's a test that we

11099
05:42:56,000 --> 05:42:57,600
can run that allows us to determine the

11100
05:42:57,600 --> 05:43:00,320
similarity this the semantic similarity

11101
05:43:00,320 --> 05:43:03,040
of two sets or or any number of set of

11102
05:43:03,040 --> 05:43:05,360
of uh actually I believe it is just for

11103
05:43:05,360 --> 05:43:08,160
two um the the the similarity of two

11104
05:43:08,160 --> 05:43:09,680
pieces of text. So whether that's a

11105
05:43:09,680 --> 05:43:11,600
word, just apples and oranges, whether

11106
05:43:11,600 --> 05:43:12,958
that's phrases, whether that's whole

11107
05:43:12,958 --> 05:43:14,718
bodies of paragraphs, whether it's a

11108
05:43:14,718 --> 05:43:18,160
whole book, uh you can use co similarity

11109
05:43:18,160 --> 05:43:21,040
to get a a tangible metric is really the

11110
05:43:21,040 --> 05:43:22,798
key thing here. A tangible metric that

11111
05:43:22,798 --> 05:43:24,638
you can point to and say yes, these two

11112
05:43:24,638 --> 05:43:26,798
things are similar. And for us with

11113
05:43:26,798 --> 05:43:28,558
these exploration milestones, we started

11114
05:43:28,558 --> 05:43:30,718
integrating cosine similarity testing as

11115
05:43:30,718 --> 05:43:32,000
part of the exploration milestone.

11116
05:43:32,000 --> 05:43:34,638
Determine if we can get the the the

11117
05:43:34,638 --> 05:43:36,878
right mathematically most similar types

11118
05:43:36,878 --> 05:43:38,320
of answers that are going to be

11119
05:43:38,320 --> 05:43:40,160
satisfactory to the client. So we can

11120
05:43:40,160 --> 05:43:41,520
kind of make sure that we know what

11121
05:43:41,520 --> 05:43:43,120
we're doing ahead of time and be like,

11122
05:43:43,120 --> 05:43:44,638
"Yep, we can get a we can get pretty

11123
05:43:44,638 --> 05:43:46,798
close to this." Uh but more importantly,

11124
05:43:46,798 --> 05:43:48,320
it gives us a a metric that we can use

11125
05:43:48,320 --> 05:43:51,520
in our contracts to stop that

11126
05:43:51,520 --> 05:43:54,240
subjectivity and oh I like the I like it

11127
05:43:54,240 --> 05:43:56,480
but like it could say this and this or

11128
05:43:56,480 --> 05:43:58,000
hey it's giving the same answer four

11129
05:43:58,000 --> 05:43:59,440
times but there's one that's different.

11130
05:43:59,440 --> 05:44:01,200
It's like well mate at the end of the

11131
05:44:01,200 --> 05:44:04,240
day our contract says it's the semantic

11132
05:44:04,240 --> 05:44:06,160
meaning of it and the similarity of the

11133
05:44:06,160 --> 05:44:08,000
text. If there's if it's one word

11134
05:44:08,000 --> 05:44:09,840
changed this thing protects us. So let

11135
05:44:09,840 --> 05:44:12,080
me let me break down how this works. So

11136
05:44:12,080 --> 05:44:14,320
cosine similarity uh this is going to

11137
05:44:14,320 --> 05:44:16,000
get a little bit technical but I do

11138
05:44:16,000 --> 05:44:17,760
quite like getting in this and it's

11139
05:44:17,760 --> 05:44:18,878
important for you guys to know this to

11140
05:44:18,878 --> 05:44:21,680
some degree. So, K similarity. This is

11141
05:44:21,680 --> 05:44:25,480
going to really challenge my uh my art

11142
05:44:25,480 --> 05:44:28,360
skills. Oh,

11143
05:44:28,360 --> 05:44:31,360
um

11144
05:44:34,040 --> 05:44:36,240
down. Oh, okay. So, that's a

11145
05:44:36,240 --> 05:44:39,120
three-dimensional space. And we're going

11146
05:44:39,120 --> 05:44:40,160
to have So, it's kind of going

11147
05:44:40,160 --> 05:44:41,520
backwards, by the way. It's not facing

11148
05:44:41,520 --> 05:44:44,718
us. So, we have one point over here. We

11149
05:44:44,718 --> 05:44:45,798
have another

11150
05:44:45,798 --> 05:44:49,200
point over here. And we have another

11151
05:44:49,200 --> 05:44:53,958
point uh up over here. And so what these

11152
05:44:53,958 --> 05:44:57,680
are is coordinates in a

11153
05:44:57,680 --> 05:44:59,120
multi-dimensional space. In this case,

11154
05:44:59,120 --> 05:45:01,040
we'll just do three dimensions so that

11155
05:45:01,040 --> 05:45:03,200
it's easy to understand, but in reality,

11156
05:45:03,200 --> 05:45:06,000
this is happening in in I think 8,000 or

11157
05:45:06,000 --> 05:45:08,638
was it 8,000 dimensions? It's impossible

11158
05:45:08,638 --> 05:45:10,638
for the human brain to comprehend, but

11159
05:45:10,638 --> 05:45:13,840
uh this will this this will suffice. Um

11160
05:45:13,840 --> 05:45:15,558
so we

11161
05:45:15,558 --> 05:45:18,840
have this 3D space. We have 0.1 point

11162
05:45:18,840 --> 05:45:21,680
2.3. And what co similarity allows us to

11163
05:45:21,680 --> 05:45:24,240
do is determine the similarity of these

11164
05:45:24,240 --> 05:45:26,638
three points. So this might be a word of

11165
05:45:26,638 --> 05:45:28,600
of

11166
05:45:28,600 --> 05:45:32,878
beans. This might be peas and this might

11167
05:45:32,878 --> 05:45:34,798
be car.

11168
05:45:34,798 --> 05:45:36,638
And so what the coine similarity test

11169
05:45:36,638 --> 05:45:38,638
does is that if we go to our client in

11170
05:45:38,638 --> 05:45:40,480
this expiration phase or in the the

11171
05:45:40,480 --> 05:45:42,480
actual contract, we will ask them for

11172
05:45:42,480 --> 05:45:44,878
hey can you give me uh five to 10

11173
05:45:44,878 --> 05:45:46,718
examples of inputs and outputs that you

11174
05:45:46,718 --> 05:45:48,558
would like out of the system and when

11175
05:45:48,558 --> 05:45:50,160
they give us the inputs and outputs we

11176
05:45:50,160 --> 05:45:52,480
then have something to grade our AI

11177
05:45:52,480 --> 05:45:55,280
outputs of the system against. So say

11178
05:45:55,280 --> 05:45:57,760
they have a chatbot and it needs to be

11179
05:45:57,760 --> 05:46:00,080
outputting a certain type of answer. We

11180
05:46:00,080 --> 05:46:02,958
can run their 11 inputs against our

11181
05:46:02,958 --> 05:46:05,160
system. So we have our system

11182
05:46:05,160 --> 05:46:08,200
here. We take the 10

11183
05:46:08,200 --> 05:46:10,480
inputs. We run them each through our

11184
05:46:10,480 --> 05:46:14,360
system and it outputs 1 2 3

11185
05:46:14,360 --> 05:46:18,760
etc. And then we have their original 10

11186
05:46:18,760 --> 05:46:21,840
inputs and the well this is the system

11187
05:46:21,840 --> 05:46:23,360
that they used to create which is their

11188
05:46:23,360 --> 05:46:25,840
own brain of okay what what should this

11189
05:46:25,840 --> 05:46:27,600
thing be answering? So this is a human.

11190
05:46:27,600 --> 05:46:30,080
This is an AI. And then it's going to

11191
05:46:30,080 --> 05:46:31,240
output

11192
05:46:31,240 --> 05:46:33,440
the well it's not really outputting the

11193
05:46:33,440 --> 05:46:34,718
brain has outputed it. But we have 10

11194
05:46:34,718 --> 05:46:36,400
and 10. And the 10 that we create from

11195
05:46:36,400 --> 05:46:38,320
our system we can then use cosine

11196
05:46:38,320 --> 05:46:41,280
similarity to get the average or we can

11197
05:46:41,280 --> 05:46:42,718
we can compare the similarity of this

11198
05:46:42,718 --> 05:46:45,520
one to this one and determine if yes our

11199
05:46:45,520 --> 05:46:48,000
AI system is creating outputs that are

11200
05:46:48,000 --> 05:46:49,760
similar enough to this and we average

11201
05:46:49,760 --> 05:46:51,280
them all and then we can get an overall

11202
05:46:51,280 --> 05:46:53,440
similarity score. So coming back to the

11203
05:46:53,440 --> 05:46:56,878
graph here, say we have this one here

11204
05:46:56,878 --> 05:47:00,080
which is is one input. It might be uh

11205
05:47:00,080 --> 05:47:03,120
how do I change my password and then

11206
05:47:03,120 --> 05:47:05,280
this one will be the AI output one and

11207
05:47:05,280 --> 05:47:06,480
this one will be the human one. They

11208
05:47:06,480 --> 05:47:07,680
might say in order to change your

11209
05:47:07,680 --> 05:47:09,760
password you need to go to XY Z website

11210
05:47:09,760 --> 05:47:11,520
and then based off the AI system that we

11211
05:47:11,520 --> 05:47:13,040
built it might say in order to change

11212
05:47:13,040 --> 05:47:15,200
your password please navigate to this.

11213
05:47:15,200 --> 05:47:17,120
So they are fairly similar and then when

11214
05:47:17,120 --> 05:47:18,080
we run them through the cosine

11215
05:47:18,080 --> 05:47:20,718
similarity test it's converting these

11216
05:47:20,718 --> 05:47:23,440
words

11217
05:47:23,440 --> 05:47:25,360
and it runs it through an embedding

11218
05:47:25,360 --> 05:47:30,080
model and the words get converted to a a

11219
05:47:30,080 --> 05:47:33,400
set of coordinates that might be like

11220
05:47:33,400 --> 05:47:36,638
0.1 0.5

11221
05:47:36,638 --> 05:47:37,798
uh

11222
05:47:37,798 --> 05:47:40,718
0.9 uh and it goes on and on and on and

11223
05:47:40,718 --> 05:47:42,638
on and on but in this case we've just

11224
05:47:42,638 --> 05:47:44,000
got three coordinates because we got a

11225
05:47:44,000 --> 05:47:45,600
threedimensional graph. So what the

11226
05:47:45,600 --> 05:47:48,080
cosine system does is it converts words

11227
05:47:48,080 --> 05:47:50,798
into their numerical equivalents within

11228
05:47:50,798 --> 05:47:52,760
a vector space and by having these

11229
05:47:52,760 --> 05:47:55,680
coordinates it can plot them in the

11230
05:47:55,680 --> 05:47:58,320
vector space by their similarity. So in

11231
05:47:58,320 --> 05:48:00,000
this case you see beans and ps are are

11232
05:48:00,000 --> 05:48:01,520
close. That's because the embedding

11233
05:48:01,520 --> 05:48:03,760
model that we use and run the beams

11234
05:48:03,760 --> 05:48:05,360
through. It's going to give out a

11235
05:48:05,360 --> 05:48:06,958
coordinate and then we run PS through

11236
05:48:06,958 --> 05:48:08,718
it. It's going to go hm okay that fits

11237
05:48:08,718 --> 05:48:10,558
there and they end up being close to

11238
05:48:10,558 --> 05:48:13,520
each other within the vector space. And

11239
05:48:13,520 --> 05:48:15,360
so how does what does cosine similar

11240
05:48:15,360 --> 05:48:17,440
similarity actually mean? Well, it's the

11241
05:48:17,440 --> 05:48:20,400
measurement of the angle between these

11242
05:48:20,400 --> 05:48:23,520
two bad boys here. So the smaller the

11243
05:48:23,520 --> 05:48:25,920
angle, the more similar they are. The

11244
05:48:25,920 --> 05:48:27,920
larger the angle, see if we go from PS

11245
05:48:27,920 --> 05:48:30,558
to car or from beans to car, the angle

11246
05:48:30,558 --> 05:48:33,600
here is much larger. Ooh, I'm getting

11247
05:48:33,600 --> 05:48:35,440
back into my my uh what was that?

11248
05:48:35,440 --> 05:48:37,200
Calculus and trigonometry and whatnot.

11249
05:48:37,200 --> 05:48:39,760
Um but yeah, beans to car is a much

11250
05:48:39,760 --> 05:48:41,200
larger angle. Therefore the co

11251
05:48:41,200 --> 05:48:44,320
similarity is going to be lower than

11252
05:48:44,320 --> 05:48:45,878
these two

11253
05:48:45,878 --> 05:48:49,520
P's. That make sense? So this is taking

11254
05:48:49,520 --> 05:48:51,760
the subjective opinions and emotions of

11255
05:48:51,760 --> 05:48:54,080
people who go h but I like the outputs.

11256
05:48:54,080 --> 05:48:56,160
I don't really like the outputs. I don't

11257
05:48:56,160 --> 05:48:59,680
care. You have told us these in the in

11258
05:48:59,680 --> 05:49:01,120
the expiration milestone. We won't

11259
05:49:01,120 --> 05:49:02,558
necessarily hold them to that in the

11260
05:49:02,558 --> 05:49:04,480
contract of the expiration milestone. It

11261
05:49:04,480 --> 05:49:06,000
would just be hey look give us some

11262
05:49:06,000 --> 05:49:08,320
outputs and we'll compare them to it and

11263
05:49:08,320 --> 05:49:10,320
internally we can check and use that in

11264
05:49:10,320 --> 05:49:11,600
the end of the report. So at the end of

11265
05:49:11,600 --> 05:49:12,958
the expiration milestone you'll give

11266
05:49:12,958 --> 05:49:14,558
them a report in a proposal which we'll

11267
05:49:14,558 --> 05:49:17,920
go into in a second. But the numbers

11268
05:49:17,920 --> 05:49:19,600
that we get back from our testing if we

11269
05:49:19,600 --> 05:49:21,360
say okay look by the way coine

11270
05:49:21,360 --> 05:49:24,558
similarity goes from zero to one. Um so

11271
05:49:24,558 --> 05:49:27,200
a high a good range uh we go for in

11272
05:49:27,200 --> 05:49:29,400
expirations we might be looking for 0.85

11273
05:49:29,400 --> 05:49:34,400
85 or or uh or higher. But for our final

11274
05:49:34,400 --> 05:49:35,520
builds, we'll be going for anywhere from

11275
05:49:35,520 --> 05:49:39,840
sort of 0.9 to 0.95 in most cases. So

11276
05:49:39,840 --> 05:49:41,480
that means it's it's highly

11277
05:49:41,480 --> 05:49:44,240
similar. And when we do our expiration

11278
05:49:44,240 --> 05:49:45,840
milestone, we'll be looking to see if we

11279
05:49:45,840 --> 05:49:47,040
can get this sort of number and say,

11280
05:49:47,040 --> 05:49:49,120
"Okay, give me those 10 10 outputs and

11281
05:49:49,120 --> 05:49:50,638
10 inputs. We're going to run it through

11282
05:49:50,638 --> 05:49:52,558
the system, see what we get. Okay, yep,

11283
05:49:52,558 --> 05:49:55,280
we're around 8.0.85 or higher. We're

11284
05:49:55,280 --> 05:49:56,558
confident that we can build the system

11285
05:49:56,558 --> 05:49:58,400
for you." So, it's as much of client

11286
05:49:58,400 --> 05:50:00,798
satisfaction as it is for our sanity. We

11287
05:50:00,798 --> 05:50:02,798
don't want to be taken on trying to take

11288
05:50:02,798 --> 05:50:04,480
down a mammoth with a slingshot, you

11289
05:50:04,480 --> 05:50:07,200
know, like we need to be taking on

11290
05:50:07,200 --> 05:50:08,480
clients that we know that we can deliver

11291
05:50:08,480 --> 05:50:10,798
for because I tell you what, these guys

11292
05:50:10,798 --> 05:50:12,958
these these early adopters have huge

11293
05:50:12,958 --> 05:50:15,280
expectations. Um, it's actually it's

11294
05:50:15,280 --> 05:50:16,718
more the people who are the sort of

11295
05:50:16,718 --> 05:50:18,080
early majority who have the bigger

11296
05:50:18,080 --> 05:50:19,840
expectations cuz they they're like, "Oh,

11297
05:50:19,840 --> 05:50:21,280
well, I've heard all the stuff about AI.

11298
05:50:21,280 --> 05:50:22,240
Let me give it a try." And they expect

11299
05:50:22,240 --> 05:50:23,280
it to just completely change the

11300
05:50:23,280 --> 05:50:24,638
business. So you need to make sure that

11301
05:50:24,638 --> 05:50:26,798
they're not expecting too much and given

11302
05:50:26,798 --> 05:50:28,400
the data and the kind of inputs and

11303
05:50:28,400 --> 05:50:30,320
outputs they have provided we are able

11304
05:50:30,320 --> 05:50:31,760
to get close enough to it that we can

11305
05:50:31,760 --> 05:50:33,760
feel confident in going for a complete

11306
05:50:33,760 --> 05:50:36,080
contract a full contract on it. So

11307
05:50:36,080 --> 05:50:38,320
that's custom similarity you can convert

11308
05:50:38,320 --> 05:50:40,400
the 10 inputs or five to 10 inputs that

11309
05:50:40,400 --> 05:50:43,360
the client gives you into uh or the

11310
05:50:43,360 --> 05:50:46,320
outputs sorry into a set of coordinates

11311
05:50:46,320 --> 05:50:47,840
or or numbers that a computer can

11312
05:50:47,840 --> 05:50:49,520
understand and when we convert these

11313
05:50:49,520 --> 05:50:51,840
over we can plot them um automatically.

11314
05:50:51,840 --> 05:50:53,120
We have a tool for this that we give to

11315
05:50:53,120 --> 05:50:54,878
our accelerator members so that they can

11316
05:50:54,878 --> 05:50:57,120
do this testing um for their clients. We

11317
05:50:57,120 --> 05:50:58,320
have an internal one as well that we use

11318
05:50:58,320 --> 05:51:00,638
at Morningside. And you just run these

11319
05:51:00,638 --> 05:51:02,558
run these outputs through the the cosine

11320
05:51:02,558 --> 05:51:04,080
similarity system. It's going to

11321
05:51:04,080 --> 05:51:05,600
determine the similarity of them and

11322
05:51:05,600 --> 05:51:06,958
then we'll average it out and say okay

11323
05:51:06,958 --> 05:51:08,080
what was the average number? So that's

11324
05:51:08,080 --> 05:51:09,160
coound

11325
05:51:09,160 --> 05:51:11,680
similarity might sound a bit complex but

11326
05:51:11,680 --> 05:51:13,200
we are dealing with complex issues and

11327
05:51:13,200 --> 05:51:15,480
complex technology. So,

11328
05:51:15,480 --> 05:51:20,280
uh, and complex emotions of clients,

11329
05:51:20,280 --> 05:51:23,638
too, and so how does this tie back

11330
05:51:23,638 --> 05:51:26,400
into the exploration system and how it

11331
05:51:26,400 --> 05:51:29,440
changed our our sales process and sort

11332
05:51:29,440 --> 05:51:30,958
of revolutionize their business and how

11333
05:51:30,958 --> 05:51:33,400
can how can you you use it too really.

11334
05:51:33,400 --> 05:51:35,520
So, now they've paid us, we've done the

11335
05:51:35,520 --> 05:51:37,958
exploration milestone and the

11336
05:51:37,958 --> 05:51:40,320
uh we then need to present the the

11337
05:51:40,320 --> 05:51:41,840
findings to them. So once you've done

11338
05:51:41,840 --> 05:51:43,840
all this work and you've you've created

11339
05:51:43,840 --> 05:51:47,200
your uh you've given this to your devs,

11340
05:51:47,200 --> 05:51:49,120
they've gone and that's a that's a

11341
05:51:49,120 --> 05:51:51,600
that's a coding symbol. Uh they've gone

11342
05:51:51,600 --> 05:51:52,718
and done the work, they've done the

11343
05:51:52,718 --> 05:51:55,040
expiration, we've got the cosine cosine

11344
05:51:55,040 --> 05:51:57,120
similarity scores out pretty confident

11345
05:51:57,120 --> 05:51:58,558
we've done enough of the expiration that

11346
05:51:58,558 --> 05:51:59,840
we can get to a point where we're

11347
05:51:59,840 --> 05:52:02,000
confident in pitching uh for the full

11348
05:52:02,000 --> 05:52:05,638
project. Now uh this comes

11349
05:52:05,638 --> 05:52:10,320
out and we now have a proposal that we

11350
05:52:10,320 --> 05:52:12,958
put together which has let's just go

11351
05:52:12,958 --> 05:52:15,520
half and half here. The first half is

11352
05:52:15,520 --> 05:52:18,200
going to be the

11353
05:52:18,200 --> 05:52:20,638
findings the findings of the exploration

11354
05:52:20,638 --> 05:52:22,878
which is hey look we did these tests and

11355
05:52:22,878 --> 05:52:24,000
these are the kind of outputs we're

11356
05:52:24,000 --> 05:52:25,120
really happy with this we were kind of

11357
05:52:25,120 --> 05:52:27,200
concerned about this. So this first half

11358
05:52:27,200 --> 05:52:29,360
is the findings and then in the second

11359
05:52:29,360 --> 05:52:31,360
half you're then going to be pitching

11360
05:52:31,360 --> 05:52:33,400
your

11361
05:52:33,400 --> 05:52:36,160
proposal and in this proposal we need to

11362
05:52:36,160 --> 05:52:38,240
have that's when you get your your

11363
05:52:38,240 --> 05:52:40,160
developer either you do it yourself or

11364
05:52:40,160 --> 05:52:42,080
or the the lead developer on your team

11365
05:52:42,080 --> 05:52:43,360
then you need to get them to create that

11366
05:52:43,360 --> 05:52:44,878
proposal which is what Spencer was doing

11367
05:52:44,878 --> 05:52:46,558
earlier in the in the older system which

11368
05:52:46,558 --> 05:52:48,718
is okay what are the sections how many

11369
05:52:48,718 --> 05:52:51,760
hours 3 4 etc. How many hours is each of

11370
05:52:51,760 --> 05:52:53,360
these things going to take and that's

11371
05:52:53,360 --> 05:52:54,798
going to determine how we can price it

11372
05:52:54,798 --> 05:52:56,320
within this proposal. So you just we

11373
05:52:56,320 --> 05:52:58,400
typically just mark up we get the our

11374
05:52:58,400 --> 05:53:00,638
estimates from our CTO Spencer and then

11375
05:53:00,638 --> 05:53:03,280
we just mark up based off our kind of

11376
05:53:03,280 --> 05:53:05,360
inflating markup rate that we apply to

11377
05:53:05,360 --> 05:53:07,680
our our services. Um so whether that's a

11378
05:53:07,680 --> 05:53:09,200
few hundred now whether that's you get

11379
05:53:09,200 --> 05:53:11,040
into thousands of dollars uh you can

11380
05:53:11,040 --> 05:53:12,718
just kind of mark that up and and apply

11381
05:53:12,718 --> 05:53:14,878
that overall and then that proposal you

11382
05:53:14,878 --> 05:53:16,200
will also

11383
05:53:16,200 --> 05:53:19,760
include gosh makes me realize how much

11384
05:53:19,760 --> 05:53:21,200
how much [ __ ] there is to cover in this

11385
05:53:21,200 --> 05:53:22,480
stuff. Uh I thought this was going to be

11386
05:53:22,480 --> 05:53:25,280
a quick video but inside the proposal

11387
05:53:25,280 --> 05:53:26,558
then you have the cosign similarity

11388
05:53:26,558 --> 05:53:28,798
score that you agree on. So this will

11389
05:53:28,798 --> 05:53:31,520
become part of the contract and that is

11390
05:53:31,520 --> 05:53:32,798
what's going to save you from the

11391
05:53:32,798 --> 05:53:35,280
subjective opinions of clients who are

11392
05:53:35,280 --> 05:53:37,280
unhappy with I don't really like how it

11393
05:53:37,280 --> 05:53:40,240
sounds that kind of rubbish. First half

11394
05:53:40,240 --> 05:53:42,240
the findings of the discovery and here

11395
05:53:42,240 --> 05:53:44,320
is we get to there's so much for me to

11396
05:53:44,320 --> 05:53:45,440
talk about on this I probably can't

11397
05:53:45,440 --> 05:53:47,200
squeeze all into this video but there's

11398
05:53:47,200 --> 05:53:49,040
a number of different factors as to why

11399
05:53:49,040 --> 05:53:50,558
this works and why it's so important.

11400
05:53:50,558 --> 05:53:52,400
Uh, one of them is that you get a chance

11401
05:53:52,400 --> 05:53:55,040
to build trust. You get to show them how

11402
05:53:55,040 --> 05:53:57,040
you operate. And this right here is the

11403
05:53:57,040 --> 05:53:58,638
most important part because they've just

11404
05:53:58,638 --> 05:54:01,360
paid you $800. It's basically like a

11405
05:54:01,360 --> 05:54:03,200
like they're just sort of having a dig

11406
05:54:03,200 --> 05:54:04,558
and saying, "Look, these guys seem

11407
05:54:04,558 --> 05:54:05,920
professional. Let's see if they really

11408
05:54:05,920 --> 05:54:08,718
know their stuff and they've given you a

11409
05:54:08,718 --> 05:54:09,920
small amount of money and you've gone

11410
05:54:09,920 --> 05:54:11,600
away that should pay your developers and

11411
05:54:11,600 --> 05:54:12,878
hopefully give you a bit of extra." So,

11412
05:54:12,878 --> 05:54:14,320
you've again, you're getting cash flow

11413
05:54:14,320 --> 05:54:15,680
here, which is great. Even if you don't

11414
05:54:15,680 --> 05:54:17,040
end up taking the project on, you can

11415
05:54:17,040 --> 05:54:18,798
just get paid to do exploration for

11416
05:54:18,798 --> 05:54:20,400
these people, which cash flow early on

11417
05:54:20,400 --> 05:54:22,320
in your agency. That that kept us alive.

11418
05:54:22,320 --> 05:54:24,798
I [ __ ] you not. But then you come down

11419
05:54:24,798 --> 05:54:27,920
here and you get a chance to show them

11420
05:54:27,920 --> 05:54:29,760
who you are. Show them how you operate.

11421
05:54:29,760 --> 05:54:31,440
Show them your level of professionalism

11422
05:54:31,440 --> 05:54:33,120
and the findings and the way that you do

11423
05:54:33,120 --> 05:54:34,558
this presentation is going to be key. So

11424
05:54:34,558 --> 05:54:36,400
this is actually done on a call. Oh, let

11425
05:54:36,400 --> 05:54:37,958
me see if I can get this

11426
05:54:37,958 --> 05:54:40,400
again. This is done on on what we call

11427
05:54:40,400 --> 05:54:42,718
our proposal call. So we'll get them on

11428
05:54:42,718 --> 05:54:44,480
a call at 30 minutes to half an hour.

11429
05:54:44,480 --> 05:54:46,080
We'll go through the findings of it very

11430
05:54:46,080 --> 05:54:47,680
professional. Hey, this is what we did.

11431
05:54:47,680 --> 05:54:49,040
We're concerned about this. This is the

11432
05:54:49,040 --> 05:54:50,958
kind of outcomes we got. This is the

11433
05:54:50,958 --> 05:54:53,120
coim similarity scores. And we you can

11434
05:54:53,120 --> 05:54:54,798
kind of introduce this as a concept on

11435
05:54:54,798 --> 05:54:56,080
these calls. We can say, hey, look,

11436
05:54:56,080 --> 05:54:57,520
given the the inputs and outputs that

11437
05:54:57,520 --> 05:54:59,840
you gave us, we were able to get to a

11438
05:54:59,840 --> 05:55:02,000
0.85 similarity, which means it's very

11439
05:55:02,000 --> 05:55:04,000
good. Um, and and with a bit more bit

11440
05:55:04,000 --> 05:55:06,160
more funding, a bit more effort, we can

11441
05:55:06,160 --> 05:55:07,600
get this to a point where it's it's far

11442
05:55:07,600 --> 05:55:09,160
more similar. It's up sort of the

11443
05:55:09,160 --> 05:55:12,558
0.90.95 range. Um, so you get to give

11444
05:55:12,558 --> 05:55:13,840
them the findings and then you give them

11445
05:55:13,840 --> 05:55:15,760
the proposal based off the estimations

11446
05:55:15,760 --> 05:55:17,520
that your your lead developer or

11447
05:55:17,520 --> 05:55:19,280
yourself have come up with. And that

11448
05:55:19,280 --> 05:55:20,480
goes in the second half, which is a

11449
05:55:20,480 --> 05:55:22,240
proposal breaking down each of the parts

11450
05:55:22,240 --> 05:55:24,320
of the full build and how much that's

11451
05:55:24,320 --> 05:55:25,840
going to cost them. On the call, you

11452
05:55:25,840 --> 05:55:27,600
need to have the contract ready. And in

11453
05:55:27,600 --> 05:55:30,240
the contract, um, if they're all good to

11454
05:55:30,240 --> 05:55:32,320
go and there's no complaints, then you

11455
05:55:32,320 --> 05:55:34,000
send them over the contract, get it

11456
05:55:34,000 --> 05:55:35,840
signed on the call if possible, cuz as

11457
05:55:35,840 --> 05:55:37,440
soon as that call ends, your chance of

11458
05:55:37,440 --> 05:55:38,958
closing them just just goes through the

11459
05:55:38,958 --> 05:55:41,280
floor. um try to get them to to sign

11460
05:55:41,280 --> 05:55:42,480
that contract on the call because as

11461
05:55:42,480 --> 05:55:43,440
soon as they signed it, doesn't matter

11462
05:55:43,440 --> 05:55:44,958
about the invoice really. If they've

11463
05:55:44,958 --> 05:55:46,878
signed that, they've made a a commitment

11464
05:55:46,878 --> 05:55:49,040
to paying that invoice as well. So, as

11465
05:55:49,040 --> 05:55:50,558
long as you can get it signed, walk them

11466
05:55:50,558 --> 05:55:52,160
through the contract, handle objections,

11467
05:55:52,160 --> 05:55:53,680
whatever you need to do. Point out that

11468
05:55:53,680 --> 05:55:55,200
the cosign similarity metric is in there

11469
05:55:55,200 --> 05:55:56,878
and say, "Hey, look, because these are

11470
05:55:56,878 --> 05:55:58,718
kind of subjective outputs, uh this is

11471
05:55:58,718 --> 05:56:00,400
something that we do to both safeguard

11472
05:56:00,400 --> 05:56:02,400
ourselves and to make sure that you are

11473
05:56:02,400 --> 05:56:04,080
protected and that we have a level of of

11474
05:56:04,080 --> 05:56:06,878
standard, a bar to work towards in the

11475
05:56:06,878 --> 05:56:08,240
quality of outputs that their system

11476
05:56:08,240 --> 05:56:09,680
generates. So having this concept of

11477
05:56:09,680 --> 05:56:11,040
similarity, pitch it as a benefit for

11478
05:56:11,040 --> 05:56:13,280
you and them, which it is, and say,

11479
05:56:13,280 --> 05:56:14,958
"Hey, look, this is the this is the

11480
05:56:14,958 --> 05:56:16,320
agreed one. We're going to be aiming for

11481
05:56:16,320 --> 05:56:18,440
0.9. Anything more than that might be

11482
05:56:18,440 --> 05:56:20,638
overfitting cuz you can make the system

11483
05:56:20,638 --> 05:56:22,798
too good at giving certain answers. Um,

11484
05:56:22,798 --> 05:56:24,400
you want to keep it at around that 0.9

11485
05:56:24,400 --> 05:56:26,480
to 0.95 range. Um, and that's what we'll

11486
05:56:26,480 --> 05:56:28,558
put in our contract." And that is the

11487
05:56:28,558 --> 05:56:30,958
way that we can stop this. If you've

11488
05:56:30,958 --> 05:56:32,480
ever done these kind of projects before

11489
05:56:32,480 --> 05:56:34,958
where it's custom custom builds, uh

11490
05:56:34,958 --> 05:56:36,320
you'll know that it can just kind of go

11491
05:56:36,320 --> 05:56:38,958
on and on and on and it's like review

11492
05:56:38,958 --> 05:56:42,240
revision hell. We call it review hell

11493
05:56:42,240 --> 05:56:44,798
and it just goes on and on and on and

11494
05:56:44,798 --> 05:56:47,440
it's so painful when you have a chatbot

11495
05:56:47,440 --> 05:56:49,120
system that you've created and then you

11496
05:56:49,120 --> 05:56:50,480
send it off to them and they send back

11497
05:56:50,480 --> 05:56:52,920
like a 30 40 minute loom and you

11498
05:56:52,920 --> 05:56:55,280
just especially when it's a low ticket

11499
05:56:55,280 --> 05:56:56,798
client as well. If you've been paid

11500
05:56:56,798 --> 05:56:58,400
three or $4,000 and you're sitting there

11501
05:56:58,400 --> 05:57:00,558
on your Saturday afternoon, going

11502
05:57:00,558 --> 05:57:03,120
through this guy's revision notes and

11503
05:57:03,120 --> 05:57:05,200
and then having to go back and fix the

11504
05:57:05,200 --> 05:57:07,200
system up and man, it is not pretty and

11505
05:57:07,200 --> 05:57:08,638
it's not the kind of lifestyle that I

11506
05:57:08,638 --> 05:57:11,760
want for my business. And so, we try to

11507
05:57:11,760 --> 05:57:13,200
avoid as much of this crap as possible

11508
05:57:13,200 --> 05:57:14,558
by saying, "Nope, we have the cosign

11509
05:57:14,558 --> 05:57:17,160
similarity. This thing is performing as

11510
05:57:17,160 --> 05:57:20,320
expected. We're done. Send me the money.

11511
05:57:20,320 --> 05:57:24,080
Send me the money." So, yeah.

11512
05:57:24,080 --> 05:57:27,680
Hope I uh got all that across, but the

11513
05:57:27,680 --> 05:57:29,200
exploration milestone has been a

11514
05:57:29,200 --> 05:57:31,440
complete game changer for us. And if you

11515
05:57:31,440 --> 05:57:32,958
want to incorporate something similar

11516
05:57:32,958 --> 05:57:34,480
into your business, while while you may

11517
05:57:34,480 --> 05:57:36,400
not do the exact same thing as a as an

11518
05:57:36,400 --> 05:57:39,040
AI agency owner, what you do need to

11519
05:57:39,040 --> 05:57:41,320
think about is this

11520
05:57:41,320 --> 05:57:44,080
line and how do I spend less time

11521
05:57:44,080 --> 05:57:46,160
talking to tire kickers who are going to

11522
05:57:46,160 --> 05:57:48,480
waste my time and how can I push quickly

11523
05:57:48,480 --> 05:57:50,480
to start filtering out? cuz you guys may

11524
05:57:50,480 --> 05:57:51,840
do some inbound lead generation, you may

11525
05:57:51,840 --> 05:57:53,680
do LinkedIn, whatever, and you may have

11526
05:57:53,680 --> 05:57:55,200
having conversations, but you'll pretty

11527
05:57:55,200 --> 05:57:56,400
quickly realize that a lot of these are

11528
05:57:56,400 --> 05:57:58,320
just conversations. And you need to

11529
05:57:58,320 --> 05:58:00,240
start finding the the guys with money to

11530
05:58:00,240 --> 05:58:01,760
spend. These are the guys you want to be

11531
05:58:01,760 --> 05:58:03,360
talking to. And this the longer you give

11532
05:58:03,360 --> 05:58:05,920
them, like there's billions of people on

11533
05:58:05,920 --> 05:58:07,440
the earth, and don't assume that all of

11534
05:58:07,440 --> 05:58:09,200
them are like you and I and are rational

11535
05:58:09,200 --> 05:58:10,878
and and don't want to waste time. Some

11536
05:58:10,878 --> 05:58:13,120
of them are deluded. Some of them have

11537
05:58:13,120 --> 05:58:15,120
mental issues and they will happily sit

11538
05:58:15,120 --> 05:58:16,958
on these calls and waste your time. And

11539
05:58:16,958 --> 05:58:18,480
that's it's not going to help your

11540
05:58:18,480 --> 05:58:19,600
business. you're going to end up

11541
05:58:19,600 --> 05:58:20,718
spending so much time talking to people

11542
05:58:20,718 --> 05:58:21,920
who are never going to be clients. While

11543
05:58:21,920 --> 05:58:23,440
it may be good sales practice if you

11544
05:58:23,440 --> 05:58:25,360
need that, but talking to a loony is

11545
05:58:25,360 --> 05:58:26,558
maybe not the best kind of sales

11546
05:58:26,558 --> 05:58:28,878
practice you you should be after. But

11547
05:58:28,878 --> 05:58:30,480
yeah, take this concept whether you

11548
05:58:30,480 --> 05:58:32,320
apply it bar for bar or whether you just

11549
05:58:32,320 --> 05:58:34,240
take the kind of distill it down and

11550
05:58:34,240 --> 05:58:35,520
say, "Hey, look, I need to put some kind

11551
05:58:35,520 --> 05:58:37,760
of filter earlier on, whether that's a

11552
05:58:37,760 --> 05:58:40,400
early on in my when I was doing calls

11553
05:58:40,400 --> 05:58:42,638
for my consulting calls on my channel, I

11554
05:58:42,638 --> 05:58:44,480
would have a $300 or $500 consulting

11555
05:58:44,480 --> 05:58:46,080
call and that those are the people that

11556
05:58:46,080 --> 05:58:47,920
would then take on as dev clients. So,

11557
05:58:47,920 --> 05:58:49,360
if they came through my consulting

11558
05:58:49,360 --> 05:58:50,240
calls, they'd already kind of

11559
05:58:50,240 --> 05:58:51,840
pre-qualified or pre-selected themselves

11560
05:58:51,840 --> 05:58:53,120
saying, "Hey, look, I'm willing to spend

11561
05:58:53,120 --> 05:58:55,360
$500 on this." So, that was kind of our

11562
05:58:55,360 --> 05:58:57,040
earlier exploration milestone, but we

11563
05:58:57,040 --> 05:58:58,638
started getting leads directly through

11564
05:58:58,638 --> 05:59:00,638
our website, not just through my uh

11565
05:59:00,638 --> 05:59:02,638
through my channel and through the

11566
05:59:02,638 --> 05:59:04,558
through the consulting calling. So,

11567
05:59:04,558 --> 05:59:08,320
yeah, take it, apply it, and this is

11568
05:59:08,320 --> 05:59:10,000
particularly good for for general

11569
05:59:10,000 --> 05:59:11,760
agencies like myself who are doing

11570
05:59:11,760 --> 05:59:13,120
custom solutions every time. if you are

11571
05:59:13,120 --> 05:59:15,600
a niche agency um and you have the same

11572
05:59:15,600 --> 05:59:17,600
thing to sell every single time maybe a

11573
05:59:17,600 --> 05:59:19,280
little bit different but I think this is

11574
05:59:19,280 --> 05:59:20,480
handy to have in your back pocket either

11575
05:59:20,480 --> 05:59:21,760
way and it will help you get past

11576
05:59:21,760 --> 05:59:24,000
$10,000 a month which was a a major

11577
05:59:24,000 --> 05:59:26,400
issue that we had and the rest is

11578
05:59:26,400 --> 05:59:28,638
history. So hope this been helpful guys.

11579
05:59:28,638 --> 05:59:32,600
Um I certainly enjoyed making it and

11580
05:59:32,600 --> 05:59:34,958
yeah exploration milestones and co

11581
05:59:34,958 --> 05:59:36,718
similarity. I hope you got it all. Uh

11582
05:59:36,718 --> 05:59:38,958
and I will see you in the next one. Keep

11583
05:59:38,958 --> 05:59:40,320
going. Uh you can do it. this

11584
05:59:40,320 --> 05:59:41,760
opportunity is not going anywhere, but

11585
05:59:41,760 --> 05:59:43,120
you need to make back. You need to make

11586
05:59:43,120 --> 05:59:44,718
moves on it now if you want to get

11587
05:59:44,718 --> 05:59:46,718
there. So, I'm rooting for you and keep

11588
05:59:46,718 --> 05:59:49,680
going.

11589
05:59:50,600 --> 05:59:52,798
Ciao. So, what is the difference between

11590
05:59:52,798 --> 05:59:54,958
a $5,000 AI agency project and one

11591
05:59:54,958 --> 05:59:55,958
that's worth

11592
05:59:55,958 --> 05:59:58,000
$105,000? In this video, I'm going to be

11593
05:59:58,000 --> 05:59:59,600
breaking down two client projects from

11594
05:59:59,600 --> 06:00:01,600
my own agency, Morningside AI. And

11595
06:00:01,600 --> 06:00:03,280
you'll get to see the differences in

11596
06:00:03,280 --> 06:00:05,440
resources and sort of effort involved in

11597
06:00:05,440 --> 06:00:06,718
each of these because you're probably

11598
06:00:06,718 --> 06:00:08,480
thinking that bigger is better, right?

11599
06:00:08,480 --> 06:00:10,160
but that's not necessarily the case and

11600
06:00:10,160 --> 06:00:11,920
it really comes down to what you want to

11601
06:00:11,920 --> 06:00:13,520
achieve with your agency. So, in this

11602
06:00:13,520 --> 06:00:14,958
video, I really want to give you a clear

11603
06:00:14,958 --> 06:00:16,958
look at the upsort of the pros and cons

11604
06:00:16,958 --> 06:00:18,798
for each of these because it's not all

11605
06:00:18,798 --> 06:00:20,080
sunshine and rainbows. And there are

11606
06:00:20,080 --> 06:00:21,440
reasons why you wouldn't want a bigger

11607
06:00:21,440 --> 06:00:23,280
client and you would want a $5,000 one

11608
06:00:23,280 --> 06:00:24,638
instead. So, I'm going to try to break

11609
06:00:24,638 --> 06:00:26,400
things down, the factors involved in

11610
06:00:26,400 --> 06:00:27,680
making these decisions so that you can

11611
06:00:27,680 --> 06:00:29,520
better aim your agency in the right

11612
06:00:29,520 --> 06:00:30,718
direction. whether you want to do one

11613
06:00:30,718 --> 06:00:32,798
that's cash flowing and sort of fairly

11614
06:00:32,798 --> 06:00:34,480
hands-free or you're trying to build a

11615
06:00:34,480 --> 06:00:36,400
large AI development company and start

11616
06:00:36,400 --> 06:00:37,680
to get bigger and bigger projects and

11617
06:00:37,680 --> 06:00:38,958
you're betting on the long term. So

11618
06:00:38,958 --> 06:00:40,558
starting off with the $5,000 project,

11619
06:00:40,558 --> 06:00:41,920
this was a client who had a business

11620
06:00:41,920 --> 06:00:43,840
base around helping people pay less on

11621
06:00:43,840 --> 06:00:45,360
their car insurance claims. So if you're

11622
06:00:45,360 --> 06:00:47,040
in an accident, you go to a repair shop,

11623
06:00:47,040 --> 06:00:48,718
they try to see or the insurance company

11624
06:00:48,718 --> 06:00:50,000
wants to try and put as much of it as

11625
06:00:50,000 --> 06:00:51,520
possible on you. Uh but there's a

11626
06:00:51,520 --> 06:00:52,718
process where you can go back and forth

11627
06:00:52,718 --> 06:00:54,160
with them and say, "No, this should be

11628
06:00:54,160 --> 06:00:55,520
covered by insurance." And that's what

11629
06:00:55,520 --> 06:00:57,040
the business was based around. and they

11630
06:00:57,040 --> 06:00:59,360
had a a human operated system for doing

11631
06:00:59,360 --> 06:01:00,878
the sort of back and forth and analyzing

11632
06:01:00,878 --> 06:01:02,320
if there's anything in the in the

11633
06:01:02,320 --> 06:01:03,760
invoices that they could sort of

11634
06:01:03,760 --> 06:01:05,360
dispute. And we were able to set up an

11635
06:01:05,360 --> 06:01:06,878
AI system to do that for them. So that

11636
06:01:06,878 --> 06:01:09,760
was a $5,000 project. The $100 to $5,000

11637
06:01:09,760 --> 06:01:12,240
project was a complete AI SAS platform

11638
06:01:12,240 --> 06:01:13,840
build that we did from start to finish.

11639
06:01:13,840 --> 06:01:16,160
We did all of the AI backends, planning

11640
06:01:16,160 --> 06:01:18,160
systems, built it from scratch, all

11641
06:01:18,160 --> 06:01:19,440
custom coded, and we also built the

11642
06:01:19,440 --> 06:01:21,240
front end as well. So, we call this one

11643
06:01:21,240 --> 06:01:25,160
a car

11644
06:01:25,160 --> 06:01:28,160
insurance

11645
06:01:30,040 --> 06:01:33,558
claims and this one

11646
06:01:33,558 --> 06:01:35,958
full

11647
06:01:35,958 --> 06:01:38,160
AIS and this was in the healthcare

11648
06:01:38,160 --> 06:01:40,160
industry. It was uh for nurses. I can't

11649
06:01:40,160 --> 06:01:41,760
go into it too much uh but it was in the

11650
06:01:41,760 --> 06:01:43,040
healthcare industry helping nurses to

11651
06:01:43,040 --> 06:01:44,558
come up to speed using these AI systems

11652
06:01:44,558 --> 06:01:46,638
that we could train them faster on. Um,

11653
06:01:46,638 --> 06:01:48,320
so that's the two different size

11654
06:01:48,320 --> 06:01:49,840
projects so you got a bit of context.

11655
06:01:49,840 --> 06:01:51,760
And for the I'll put bing bing some some

11656
06:01:51,760 --> 06:01:53,440
some screenshots on on screen. There was

11657
06:01:53,440 --> 06:01:54,718
just a single payment for this I

11658
06:01:54,718 --> 06:01:56,638
believe. Um, and for this it was three

11659
06:01:56,638 --> 06:01:57,520
different three or four different

11660
06:01:57,520 --> 06:01:58,638
payments. And this is now on a

11661
06:01:58,638 --> 06:02:00,080
maintenance package with us who we get

11662
06:02:00,080 --> 06:02:01,680
paid monthly to maintain it and sort of

11663
06:02:01,680 --> 06:02:03,520
add add not add features but we're just

11664
06:02:03,520 --> 06:02:05,360
maintaining it for now. Um, and also

11665
06:02:05,360 --> 06:02:07,040
being there on hand to fix any bug fixes

11666
06:02:07,040 --> 06:02:10,000
that come along. So there's a couple key

11667
06:02:10,000 --> 06:02:11,440
areas that I want to break down for for

11668
06:02:11,440 --> 06:02:13,440
these so you understand the associated

11669
06:02:13,440 --> 06:02:14,878
sort of pros and cons for each. Right.

11670
06:02:14,878 --> 06:02:17,840
So, a $5,000 project by nature, uh, let

11671
06:02:17,840 --> 06:02:20,080
me draw up a bit of a table here. So, I

11672
06:02:20,080 --> 06:02:22,080
have a table here. We can start to sort

11673
06:02:22,080 --> 06:02:23,840
of lay out the difference between the

11674
06:02:23,840 --> 06:02:25,920
two in a number of different areas. Then

11675
06:02:25,920 --> 06:02:28,200
we can have prod

11676
06:02:28,200 --> 06:02:30,558
here. So, the type of project, we can

11677
06:02:30,558 --> 06:02:32,280
have

11678
06:02:32,280 --> 06:02:35,360
admin, we can have sales. This will make

11679
06:02:35,360 --> 06:02:37,280
sense in a second. Give me a minute.

11680
06:02:37,280 --> 06:02:39,840
Sales. Uh, then we can have the case

11681
06:02:39,840 --> 06:02:44,558
study value. We can have the profit.

11682
06:02:44,558 --> 06:02:46,878
And then we could have the duration

11683
06:02:46,878 --> 06:02:49,040
that's a clock. Um and then we can

11684
06:02:49,040 --> 06:02:51,040
divide these up. So these are the

11685
06:02:51,040 --> 06:02:53,360
different sort of factors or or cost

11686
06:02:53,360 --> 06:02:54,958
associated with them. We have the

11687
06:02:54,958 --> 06:02:57,520
project itself. We have the admin time.

11688
06:02:57,520 --> 06:02:59,520
We have the sales time. We have the case

11689
06:02:59,520 --> 06:03:02,160
study value. We have the profitability

11690
06:03:02,160 --> 06:03:03,920
or profit of the of the entire build.

11691
06:03:03,920 --> 06:03:06,080
Then we have the time that it takes. So

11692
06:03:06,080 --> 06:03:07,360
uh there's also other factors which are

11693
06:03:07,360 --> 06:03:08,638
going to but this is this will get us

11694
06:03:08,638 --> 06:03:11,200
started for now. So we have the project

11695
06:03:11,200 --> 06:03:13,080
here. We have the

11696
06:03:13,080 --> 06:03:15,480
5k.

11697
06:03:15,480 --> 06:03:20,680
Oh, 5k. And this one down here, we have

11698
06:03:20,680 --> 06:03:23,680
the

11699
06:03:25,400 --> 06:03:27,680
105k. So, just putting these on quickly.

11700
06:03:27,680 --> 06:03:30,200
We had 1 hour here, we

11701
06:03:30,200 --> 06:03:33,280
had here, and then we had 3 hours here,

11702
06:03:33,280 --> 06:03:35,920
and we probably had about 15 here. So,

11703
06:03:35,920 --> 06:03:37,638
this is the time

11704
06:03:37,638 --> 06:03:40,320
involvement on the sales side and on the

11705
06:03:40,320 --> 06:03:43,120
admin side. So, just to uh get this 5K

11706
06:03:43,120 --> 06:03:45,920
deal, it's not $5, it's $5,000. Just to

11707
06:03:45,920 --> 06:03:47,840
get this $5,000 deal closed, we had to

11708
06:03:47,840 --> 06:03:49,760
do an an hour's worth of sales. So, that

11709
06:03:49,760 --> 06:03:51,680
might be just two two calls, one

11710
06:03:51,680 --> 06:03:52,878
discovery call, and then one follow-up

11711
06:03:52,878 --> 06:03:54,638
call just to get started. And then that

11712
06:03:54,638 --> 06:03:56,878
went into about 3 hours of admin. So,

11713
06:03:56,878 --> 06:03:58,160
throughout the duration of the project,

11714
06:03:58,160 --> 06:04:00,000
which I can put down here, uh, which was

11715
06:04:00,000 --> 06:04:03,240
3 weeks,

11716
06:04:04,000 --> 06:04:07,600
um, and this one was, uh, sort of three

11717
06:04:07,600 --> 06:04:10,958
and a half months. So, a lot longer,

11718
06:04:10,958 --> 06:04:12,320
right? So, you can see off the bat that

11719
06:04:12,320 --> 06:04:14,798
the smaller project is easier to get on,

11720
06:04:14,798 --> 06:04:17,120
easier to sign. Um, there's less admin

11721
06:04:17,120 --> 06:04:18,400
involved throughout the duration of the

11722
06:04:18,400 --> 06:04:20,958
build. Um, and it's done in a in a

11723
06:04:20,958 --> 06:04:22,400
faster amount of time, right? 3 weeks to

11724
06:04:22,400 --> 06:04:24,480
get the money. Um, and in this case, we

11725
06:04:24,480 --> 06:04:27,120
spending over 10 hours of messing around

11726
06:04:27,120 --> 06:04:28,558
with proposals and going back and forth

11727
06:04:28,558 --> 06:04:30,958
and identifying the scope. Because it's

11728
06:04:30,958 --> 06:04:33,040
such a big project, there's so many more

11729
06:04:33,040 --> 06:04:34,558
questions you need to ask about the from

11730
06:04:34,558 --> 06:04:36,718
the client and do far far more discovery

11731
06:04:36,718 --> 06:04:38,240
and digging to really plan out, okay,

11732
06:04:38,240 --> 06:04:39,280
this is the scope of the project. this

11733
06:04:39,280 --> 06:04:40,798
is what we're going to do. Um, and then

11734
06:04:40,798 --> 06:04:42,718
there's this kind of awkward stage where

11735
06:04:42,718 --> 06:04:44,160
like they know what they want, but they

11736
06:04:44,160 --> 06:04:45,520
kind of want to see the designs and see

11737
06:04:45,520 --> 06:04:46,558
the plans and it's like, well, you need

11738
06:04:46,558 --> 06:04:48,440
to pay us for that. So, we need to do an

11739
06:04:48,440 --> 06:04:50,400
exploration. Uh, there's quite a lot

11740
06:04:50,400 --> 06:04:51,760
involved here as you can imagine. So,

11741
06:04:51,760 --> 06:04:53,120
for the customer to be willing to get

11742
06:04:53,120 --> 06:04:55,360
into a $100,000 contract, there's a lot

11743
06:04:55,360 --> 06:04:56,718
of work and sort of relationship

11744
06:04:56,718 --> 06:04:58,160
building that needs to be done as well.

11745
06:04:58,160 --> 06:04:59,520
Then we have a factor here called the

11746
06:04:59,520 --> 06:05:01,440
case study grade. Um, and because this

11747
06:05:01,440 --> 06:05:03,680
is a fairly basic AI sort of system

11748
06:05:03,680 --> 06:05:05,600
that's not too flashy, um, you're really

11749
06:05:05,600 --> 06:05:07,840
getting it might be handy. case study is

11750
06:05:07,840 --> 06:05:09,520
always going to be handy. Um, but this

11751
06:05:09,520 --> 06:05:12,160
one is not hugely. Um, in terms of

11752
06:05:12,160 --> 06:05:13,760
impressing other clients, like, hey, we

11753
06:05:13,760 --> 06:05:15,520
built a $5,000 system for this kind of

11754
06:05:15,520 --> 06:05:17,040
client. It's not, at least for what

11755
06:05:17,040 --> 06:05:18,878
we're doing at my my company, it's not

11756
06:05:18,878 --> 06:05:21,920
hugely impressive. Um, but a complete AI

11757
06:05:21,920 --> 06:05:24,080
SAS build is let's well, you can always

11758
06:05:24,080 --> 06:05:25,520
be better, but we'll give it a 9 out of

11759
06:05:25,520 --> 06:05:27,440
10. We can show our clients that we

11760
06:05:27,440 --> 06:05:29,280
built this end to end SAS, and they're

11761
06:05:29,280 --> 06:05:30,798
like, well, well, if they can do that,

11762
06:05:30,798 --> 06:05:32,558
then I'm sure they can do everything

11763
06:05:32,558 --> 06:05:35,600
everything underneath that. Uh then we

11764
06:05:35,600 --> 06:05:37,520
have the actual profit for this. So on

11765
06:05:37,520 --> 06:05:41,080
this build it was oh it was

11766
06:05:41,080 --> 06:05:44,920
3,000 and on this build it was

11767
06:05:44,920 --> 06:05:48,958
31,000. So you can see 5,000 into 3,000

11768
06:05:48,958 --> 06:05:50,958
105 into 31. You can see the profit

11769
06:05:50,958 --> 06:05:53,040
margins on these are very different. Uh

11770
06:05:53,040 --> 06:05:55,760
this is over over 50%. And this is like

11771
06:05:55,760 --> 06:05:58,480
30% profit margins right? So, uh, for

11772
06:05:58,480 --> 06:05:59,600
the amount of time you're putting in,

11773
06:05:59,600 --> 06:06:00,400
this is when you need to start

11774
06:06:00,400 --> 06:06:02,558
evaluating, okay, well, do I want to be

11775
06:06:02,558 --> 06:06:04,480
getting sort of better returns on my

11776
06:06:04,480 --> 06:06:06,160
time here? Cuz this is 3 weeks. You did

11777
06:06:06,160 --> 06:06:07,600
a quick maths here, and you said, okay,

11778
06:06:07,600 --> 06:06:09,240
this is going to be

11779
06:06:09,240 --> 06:06:13,520
1,000 profit, PPW, $1,000 in profit per

11780
06:06:13,520 --> 06:06:15,600
week. Um, 3 and a half months. I guess

11781
06:06:15,600 --> 06:06:17,680
you can say that 10k per month. um go

11782
06:06:17,680 --> 06:06:22,280
down to what two 2.3 maybe 2.3

11783
06:06:22,280 --> 06:06:25,160
um

11784
06:06:25,160 --> 06:06:26,680
KP

11785
06:06:26,680 --> 06:06:29,600
week. Is that right? Something like

11786
06:06:29,600 --> 06:06:31,280
that. Maybe about 2,000 profit per week.

11787
06:06:31,280 --> 06:06:33,320
I'll get Sean to check the math on

11788
06:06:33,320 --> 06:06:36,160
that. But yes, so keeping these in mind,

11789
06:06:36,160 --> 06:06:37,520
you're going to make a lot more money

11790
06:06:37,520 --> 06:06:39,520
per project in terms of profitability.

11791
06:06:39,520 --> 06:06:40,878
But this is going to take a lot longer.

11792
06:06:40,878 --> 06:06:42,160
You're going to get better case studies.

11793
06:06:42,160 --> 06:06:43,200
You're going to spend a lot more time

11794
06:06:43,200 --> 06:06:44,878
going back and forth. And this doesn't

11795
06:06:44,878 --> 06:06:47,280
even factor in the the the fact that in

11796
06:06:47,280 --> 06:06:49,040
order to get this, you might have had to

11797
06:06:49,040 --> 06:06:50,320
have three to five of these in the

11798
06:06:50,320 --> 06:06:51,920
pipeline. We've had lots of people

11799
06:06:51,920 --> 06:06:53,440
interested in building these AI SASes

11800
06:06:53,440 --> 06:06:55,680
with us, but very few get to the point

11801
06:06:55,680 --> 06:06:57,120
of completion because there's a 10-hour

11802
06:06:57,120 --> 06:06:58,718
sales process and then they have to make

11803
06:06:58,718 --> 06:07:00,878
these big commitments of $105,000. So,

11804
06:07:00,878 --> 06:07:02,400
this doesn't even factor in the sort of

11805
06:07:02,400 --> 06:07:03,920
fail rate of this. So, we might have to

11806
06:07:03,920 --> 06:07:06,558
put like times five on this cuz there's

11807
06:07:06,558 --> 06:07:08,000
five times it's failed before we even

11808
06:07:08,000 --> 06:07:09,440
get to one. But, in this case, we might

11809
06:07:09,440 --> 06:07:11,520
have just had five of them and it ends

11810
06:07:11,520 --> 06:07:14,160
up being 5 hours total. So, hope that

11811
06:07:14,160 --> 06:07:15,520
gives you a good idea of the different

11812
06:07:15,520 --> 06:07:17,280
pros and cons. Uh, obviously bigger

11813
06:07:17,280 --> 06:07:18,718
clients, bigger projects going to take

11814
06:07:18,718 --> 06:07:20,638
more investment on the sort of

11815
06:07:20,638 --> 06:07:22,160
relationship building and sales side.

11816
06:07:22,160 --> 06:07:23,680
There's bigger proposals to do. There's

11817
06:07:23,680 --> 06:07:24,958
more refinement of the proposal,

11818
06:07:24,958 --> 06:07:27,520
agreeing on scope, much larger timelines

11819
06:07:27,520 --> 06:07:28,798
just in general. This is going to take

11820
06:07:28,798 --> 06:07:30,958
you like a month and a bit or more just

11821
06:07:30,958 --> 06:07:31,920
to get them to the point where they're

11822
06:07:31,920 --> 06:07:33,920
willing to commit. Um, you can use what

11823
06:07:33,920 --> 06:07:35,360
we like to do, which is an exploration

11824
06:07:35,360 --> 06:07:36,480
milestone, which I think I'm going to

11825
06:07:36,480 --> 06:07:38,000
cover in another video, but that can

11826
06:07:38,000 --> 06:07:39,280
actually break down the sales process

11827
06:07:39,280 --> 06:07:41,280
and get these bigger clients on board a

11828
06:07:41,280 --> 06:07:43,040
lot sooner. But you'll have to subscribe

11829
06:07:43,040 --> 06:07:44,798
or or like or something to catch that

11830
06:07:44,798 --> 06:07:45,920
next one cuz I want to do a whole video

11831
06:07:45,920 --> 06:07:47,360
on exploration milestones. I don't want

11832
06:07:47,360 --> 06:07:48,558
to get sucked into it on this. And

11833
06:07:48,558 --> 06:07:49,600
there's actually one more thing that I

11834
06:07:49,600 --> 06:07:51,680
want to add on here um which you can

11835
06:07:51,680 --> 06:07:55,040
call sort of company culture um and the

11836
06:07:55,040 --> 06:07:56,160
way that these different projects have

11837
06:07:56,160 --> 06:07:58,920
an effect um

11838
06:07:58,920 --> 06:08:01,120
culture. Um I'm going to have to do a

11839
06:08:01,120 --> 06:08:04,480
bit of a quick job on this one, but the

11840
06:08:04,480 --> 06:08:06,080
effect on company culture. If you're

11841
06:08:06,080 --> 06:08:09,200
trying to build a development team and a

11842
06:08:09,200 --> 06:08:10,718
a a collection of people who are

11843
06:08:10,718 --> 06:08:12,320
inspired and feel like they are working

11844
06:08:12,320 --> 06:08:14,718
towards cool things, building $5,000

11845
06:08:14,718 --> 06:08:16,160
chat bots or in this case sort of

11846
06:08:16,160 --> 06:08:19,040
automation systems is is a way to get

11847
06:08:19,040 --> 06:08:20,718
money in the door, but it's not going to

11848
06:08:20,718 --> 06:08:22,400
fire up your A players when you're

11849
06:08:22,400 --> 06:08:24,958
trying to bring in attract and retain

11850
06:08:24,958 --> 06:08:27,240
highquality talent. There's only so many

11851
06:08:27,240 --> 06:08:29,600
$5,000 little chatbot builds you can do

11852
06:08:29,600 --> 06:08:31,120
before they start going, "Hey, look, I

11853
06:08:31,120 --> 06:08:32,638
want to either be get paid more or I

11854
06:08:32,638 --> 06:08:33,600
want to go somewhere where I'm feeling

11855
06:08:33,600 --> 06:08:35,280
more fulfilled because they have the

11856
06:08:35,280 --> 06:08:36,558
skills to be able to go anywhere and get

11857
06:08:36,558 --> 06:08:38,000
hired by anyone." So, they're really

11858
06:08:38,000 --> 06:08:39,280
looking for what you can add on top of

11859
06:08:39,280 --> 06:08:41,440
just monetary, which is adding some kind

11860
06:08:41,440 --> 06:08:43,600
of interesting aspect to it. Like, hey,

11861
06:08:43,600 --> 06:08:45,280
look, I just built out an entire AI SAS

11862
06:08:45,280 --> 06:08:46,920
that could revolutionize the healthcare

11863
06:08:46,920 --> 06:08:49,040
industry, or I've just built these

11864
06:08:49,040 --> 06:08:51,200
chatbots. So, you have to look at

11865
06:08:51,200 --> 06:08:53,840
culture here. Maybe I do red. Um the

11866
06:08:53,840 --> 06:08:55,440
culture and the effect of it on the

11867
06:08:55,440 --> 06:08:58,480
company culture goes down. So we saw our

11868
06:08:58,480 --> 06:09:00,558
team, our development team was extremely

11869
06:09:00,558 --> 06:09:02,240
fired up throughout the the entire build

11870
06:09:02,240 --> 06:09:03,840
of this cuz it was cool. We're working

11871
06:09:03,840 --> 06:09:05,680
with a client that we really liked. The

11872
06:09:05,680 --> 06:09:07,280
our client is awesome and we've got him

11873
06:09:07,280 --> 06:09:08,558
on retainer now. So he's we're

11874
06:09:08,558 --> 06:09:09,600
continuing to work with him and we're

11875
06:09:09,600 --> 06:09:11,120
like going to build future features into

11876
06:09:11,120 --> 06:09:13,920
the platform longer term. Um but our

11877
06:09:13,920 --> 06:09:15,280
developers got to work directly with a

11878
06:09:15,280 --> 06:09:16,958
really cool client who had great values

11879
06:09:16,958 --> 06:09:19,120
and was excited to work with us as well.

11880
06:09:19,120 --> 06:09:20,878
And the end result was such a great

11881
06:09:20,878 --> 06:09:23,360
outcome for our team as as us as this

11882
06:09:23,360 --> 06:09:26,000
this start AI startup that started 12

11883
06:09:26,000 --> 06:09:27,920
months ago, 14 probably about 12 months

11884
06:09:27,920 --> 06:09:31,280
ago now. Um, we were able to go from

11885
06:09:31,280 --> 06:09:33,280
these small basic chat bots right up to

11886
06:09:33,280 --> 06:09:35,360
knocking off a complete SAS build that

11887
06:09:35,360 --> 06:09:37,360
the client was absolutely like wrapped.

11888
06:09:37,360 --> 06:09:38,958
They was so happy with the outcome and

11889
06:09:38,958 --> 06:09:40,718
for myself, my business partner Josh, my

11890
06:09:40,718 --> 06:09:42,558
CTO Spencer, for all of us to be working

11891
06:09:42,558 --> 06:09:44,160
on this project to completion and see it

11892
06:09:44,160 --> 06:09:46,080
come together uh was a really really

11893
06:09:46,080 --> 06:09:47,840
great moment and a high point for us as

11894
06:09:47,840 --> 06:09:49,920
a team and and seeing that we could do

11895
06:09:49,920 --> 06:09:51,120
these large projects and we could pull

11896
06:09:51,120 --> 06:09:53,200
it off together. So, uh, the culture and

11897
06:09:53,200 --> 06:09:54,400
the effect of these larger projects

11898
06:09:54,400 --> 06:09:56,160
cannot be understated. If you want to

11899
06:09:56,160 --> 06:09:58,638
attract quality talent and retain them,

11900
06:09:58,638 --> 06:10:00,480
you can't just be feeding them sort of

11901
06:10:00,480 --> 06:10:01,920
small projects constantly. So, just keep

11902
06:10:01,920 --> 06:10:03,600
that in mind. And this brings me back

11903
06:10:03,600 --> 06:10:05,040
around full circle to what I was saying

11904
06:10:05,040 --> 06:10:07,040
before, and I can rub this off now,

11905
06:10:07,040 --> 06:10:09,520
which is which kind of project should

11906
06:10:09,520 --> 06:10:11,200
you be aiming for? And that comes down

11907
06:10:11,200 --> 06:10:13,440
to what kind of agency you want to

11908
06:10:13,440 --> 06:10:15,120
build? What are your goals with this

11909
06:10:15,120 --> 06:10:16,718
business model? What are your goals with

11910
06:10:16,718 --> 06:10:19,920
the AI space? Are you looking to create

11911
06:10:19,920 --> 06:10:21,360
cash flow and just get off the ground

11912
06:10:21,360 --> 06:10:22,958
and be able to make money online so you

11913
06:10:22,958 --> 06:10:26,160
can go live as a digital nomad and and

11914
06:10:26,160 --> 06:10:28,480
go to Bali and do all this cool stuff?

11915
06:10:28,480 --> 06:10:29,920
Or are you looking to build enterprise

11916
06:10:29,920 --> 06:10:32,160
value, build a valuable team? And in

11917
06:10:32,160 --> 06:10:33,440
that case, we can kind of plot it on a

11918
06:10:33,440 --> 06:10:36,558
bit of an axis here um between okay,

11919
06:10:36,558 --> 06:10:38,160
over here is someone who wants maybe

11920
06:10:38,160 --> 06:10:40,400
cash

11921
06:10:41,160 --> 06:10:45,160
flow, freedom,

11922
06:10:45,360 --> 06:10:48,520
etc. And over here you want

11923
06:10:48,520 --> 06:10:51,240
in to

11924
06:10:51,240 --> 06:10:54,680
pro value

11925
06:10:54,680 --> 06:10:57,320
um

11926
06:10:57,320 --> 06:10:59,878
great

11927
06:10:59,878 --> 06:11:02,600
team

11928
06:11:02,600 --> 06:11:04,680
culture and

11929
06:11:04,680 --> 06:11:07,680
really

11930
06:11:08,520 --> 06:11:11,520
highly

11931
06:11:11,878 --> 06:11:14,080
capable. So, if you're just looking to

11932
06:11:14,080 --> 06:11:15,920
use one of these businesses to get

11933
06:11:15,920 --> 06:11:17,680
yourself making money online and get

11934
06:11:17,680 --> 06:11:19,840
started, then you need to potentially

11935
06:11:19,840 --> 06:11:21,360
focus on these lower ticket clients

11936
06:11:21,360 --> 06:11:23,280
first, right? You I mean, by first, you

11937
06:11:23,280 --> 06:11:24,718
kind of you can't really just jump to

11938
06:11:24,718 --> 06:11:25,600
this. You're going to have to do these

11939
06:11:25,600 --> 06:11:27,200
first anyway in order to get up to the

11940
06:11:27,200 --> 06:11:28,320
stage where you can have enough

11941
06:11:28,320 --> 06:11:30,000
credibility and evidence that you are

11942
06:11:30,000 --> 06:11:32,400
able of able to develop one of these. Uh

11943
06:11:32,400 --> 06:11:34,080
but when it comes to picking where you

11944
06:11:34,080 --> 06:11:35,760
want to fall on this on the scale, you

11945
06:11:35,760 --> 06:11:37,120
need to keep in mind that this is not

11946
06:11:37,120 --> 06:11:38,480
these kind of businesses are not going

11947
06:11:38,480 --> 06:11:41,680
to uh scale to these sort of valuations

11948
06:11:41,680 --> 06:11:44,000
and exitable sort of valuations that you

11949
06:11:44,000 --> 06:11:45,200
might be looking for here. So it's more

11950
06:11:45,200 --> 06:11:46,798
of a a self-awareness thing of knowing

11951
06:11:46,798 --> 06:11:49,360
what you want out of this opportunity.

11952
06:11:49,360 --> 06:11:51,920
Um and in this case for for myself

11953
06:11:51,920 --> 06:11:54,400
there's costs that are involved here. As

11954
06:11:54,400 --> 06:11:58,798
you saw the there was lower

11955
06:12:00,840 --> 06:12:06,638
profitability, there's higher admin and

11956
06:12:07,798 --> 06:12:11,200
sales. Sorry, that's really ugly. But

11957
06:12:11,200 --> 06:12:13,120
there are pros and cons to these. So in

11958
06:12:13,120 --> 06:12:14,400
this case, you're sort of betting on a

11959
06:12:14,400 --> 06:12:16,480
longerterm play in that look, I'm going

11960
06:12:16,480 --> 06:12:18,400
to sacrifice some profitability and I'm

11961
06:12:18,400 --> 06:12:20,040
going to have to deal with more admin

11962
06:12:20,040 --> 06:12:23,360
and longer sales processes, etc., But

11963
06:12:23,360 --> 06:12:24,638
I'm going to be able to create more

11964
06:12:24,638 --> 06:12:26,638
value through the team that I build and

11965
06:12:26,638 --> 06:12:27,760
through the culture that I'm building

11966
06:12:27,760 --> 06:12:29,360
and the enterprise value overall of the

11967
06:12:29,360 --> 06:12:32,000
the organization. But in this case, your

11968
06:12:32,000 --> 06:12:35,760
profitability is going to be going way

11969
06:12:37,000 --> 06:12:40,718
up. While while net profits may not be

11970
06:12:40,718 --> 06:12:42,000
uh be drastically different, it's still

11971
06:12:42,000 --> 06:12:43,280
in terms of input and output. You're

11972
06:12:43,280 --> 06:12:45,280
getting more more juice for the for the

11973
06:12:45,280 --> 06:12:46,400
amount of squeeze you put in. If that's

11974
06:12:46,400 --> 06:12:48,558
a good analogy to use. Um and in this

11975
06:12:48,558 --> 06:12:52,798
case, uh there's less admin

11976
06:12:52,798 --> 06:12:55,040
admin. So, there is a opportunity for

11977
06:12:55,040 --> 06:12:57,280
you to create one of these lower ticket

11978
06:12:57,280 --> 06:12:58,718
agencies. So, we can say that we wanted

11979
06:12:58,718 --> 06:12:59,920
to niche down to these car insurance

11980
06:12:59,920 --> 06:13:01,600
claims. Um, it's actually quite a small

11981
06:13:01,600 --> 06:13:02,878
market, I believe. So, we didn't bother

11982
06:13:02,878 --> 06:13:04,080
niching down and morning side to do

11983
06:13:04,080 --> 06:13:05,120
something like this. We could say,

11984
06:13:05,120 --> 06:13:07,120
"Okay, I just want to do five of these a

11985
06:13:07,120 --> 06:13:08,638
month or let's let's say three of them a

11986
06:13:08,638 --> 06:13:10,958
month, 15k in rev." And that was $3,000

11987
06:13:10,958 --> 06:13:12,240
profit a piece. That would probably

11988
06:13:12,240 --> 06:13:14,160
increase over time because the first

11989
06:13:14,160 --> 06:13:15,600
time that we built it is the hardest and

11990
06:13:15,600 --> 06:13:16,558
we had to come up with all these

11991
06:13:16,558 --> 06:13:18,160
systems. But if I was to replicate that

11992
06:13:18,160 --> 06:13:20,558
over to another person's uh build, I've

11993
06:13:20,558 --> 06:13:21,760
already got all the systems. I just need

11994
06:13:21,760 --> 06:13:23,120
to tweak it a little bit. So the

11995
06:13:23,120 --> 06:13:25,440
profitability actually goes much further

11996
06:13:25,440 --> 06:13:28,000
up. Um let me do like an extra big arrow

11997
06:13:28,000 --> 06:13:30,718
there. If you're going to niche down, so

11998
06:13:30,718 --> 06:13:32,638
in this case, I haven't talked about

11999
06:13:32,638 --> 06:13:34,000
niched and general agencies for a while

12000
06:13:34,000 --> 06:13:35,520
on the channel. Um but I do throughout

12001
06:13:35,520 --> 06:13:37,760
my community and ALM and things like

12002
06:13:37,760 --> 06:13:39,760
this. The difference between a niched

12003
06:13:39,760 --> 06:13:41,760
agency and a and a general one is that

12004
06:13:41,760 --> 06:13:43,200
you're going to be able to focus on just

12005
06:13:43,200 --> 06:13:46,558
one particular solution or or niche. In

12006
06:13:46,558 --> 06:13:47,360
that case, you're going to be able to

12007
06:13:47,360 --> 06:13:48,558
roll over the tech that you've built for

12008
06:13:48,558 --> 06:13:50,320
the prior clients into the future one.

12009
06:13:50,320 --> 06:13:51,440
So that it means there's increased

12010
06:13:51,440 --> 06:13:52,638
profitability because you're not having

12011
06:13:52,638 --> 06:13:54,080
to come up with a new solution every

12012
06:13:54,080 --> 06:13:56,000
time. Um, now very few people get to the

12013
06:13:56,000 --> 06:13:57,440
stage of doing this properly because we

12014
06:13:57,440 --> 06:13:59,040
like to jump around and go. I mean, we

12015
06:13:59,040 --> 06:13:59,920
were even doing the same thing at

12016
06:13:59,920 --> 06:14:01,200
Morningside because of the leads that

12017
06:14:01,200 --> 06:14:02,638
come from my channel. We like to stay

12018
06:14:02,638 --> 06:14:03,920
general and do sort of cool things

12019
06:14:03,920 --> 06:14:05,440
wherever we think we're a good fit for

12020
06:14:05,440 --> 06:14:06,958
them, right? But if you're just looking

12021
06:14:06,958 --> 06:14:09,200
to start off, get a cash flow business

12022
06:14:09,200 --> 06:14:12,718
and be making 15, $20,000 a month, then

12023
06:14:12,718 --> 06:14:14,320
looking at, okay, I can just focus on

12024
06:14:14,320 --> 06:14:16,000
these small lower ticket clients and try

12025
06:14:16,000 --> 06:14:17,440
to get cash flow and the freedom that I

12026
06:14:17,440 --> 06:14:19,040
want. And then maybe later once you've

12027
06:14:19,040 --> 06:14:20,240
got a bit more experience, you can try

12028
06:14:20,240 --> 06:14:22,400
to go for the more custom projects and

12029
06:14:22,400 --> 06:14:24,160
uh and make more money that way. But it

12030
06:14:24,160 --> 06:14:26,320
is a longer term play. And if you think

12031
06:14:26,320 --> 06:14:28,400
AI agency as a as a sort of development

12032
06:14:28,400 --> 06:14:29,840
company is the play for you, this is

12033
06:14:29,840 --> 06:14:31,600
what you need to go for. But if you're

12034
06:14:31,600 --> 06:14:33,040
trying to jump to some kind of SAS and

12035
06:14:33,040 --> 06:14:34,480
you just want the cash flow and sort of

12036
06:14:34,480 --> 06:14:36,798
the basic team needed to do it, uh this

12037
06:14:36,798 --> 06:14:39,120
can also be a good option too. So hope

12038
06:14:39,120 --> 06:14:41,200
that's been a breakdown of the

12039
06:14:41,200 --> 06:14:42,878
difference between the low ticket and

12040
06:14:42,878 --> 06:14:44,798
high ticket clients. It's not bigger is

12041
06:14:44,798 --> 06:14:45,920
not always better is what I'm trying to

12042
06:14:45,920 --> 06:14:47,440
point out here. And it does depend

12043
06:14:47,440 --> 06:14:49,760
entirely on your on your goals in the

12044
06:14:49,760 --> 06:14:51,040
space. And one more point that I want to

12045
06:14:51,040 --> 06:14:53,920
make is that if you were to do like why

12046
06:14:53,920 --> 06:14:58,000
$5,000, why not a $1,000 project? Well,

12047
06:14:58,000 --> 06:14:59,760
you'll find when you do the old grid

12048
06:14:59,760 --> 06:15:01,920
automatic like I did before, you'll see

12049
06:15:01,920 --> 06:15:04,638
that the admin involvement of doing a

12050
06:15:04,638 --> 06:15:06,558
$1,000 project is about the same as a

12051
06:15:06,558 --> 06:15:08,798
$5,000 project or even a $10,000 project

12052
06:15:08,798 --> 06:15:10,080
sometimes. So, there's this this kind of

12053
06:15:10,080 --> 06:15:12,480
goldilock sweet spot zone where you're

12054
06:15:12,480 --> 06:15:13,920
doing the same amount of admin for more

12055
06:15:13,920 --> 06:15:15,280
money, which is why at Morningside we

12056
06:15:15,280 --> 06:15:17,440
have a minimum of

12057
06:15:17,440 --> 06:15:20,160
$10,000 project. So, we just ignore

12058
06:15:20,160 --> 06:15:23,040
anything that's sub $10,000 uh just cuz

12059
06:15:23,040 --> 06:15:24,320
it's not worth the time. I don't want to

12060
06:15:24,320 --> 06:15:25,600
be getting on sales calls. My business

12061
06:15:25,600 --> 06:15:27,040
partner Josh doesn't want to take them.

12062
06:15:27,040 --> 06:15:29,440
if we're going to make $5,000 because we

12063
06:15:29,440 --> 06:15:31,360
know how much time discovery call sort

12064
06:15:31,360 --> 06:15:33,040
of closing call, write a proposal, write

12065
06:15:33,040 --> 06:15:34,878
the contract, send it off, build it,

12066
06:15:34,878 --> 06:15:36,240
review it, build it, review it, we get

12067
06:15:36,240 --> 06:15:38,480
involved, something breaks, it's like

12068
06:15:38,480 --> 06:15:40,080
not what I want to be involved in, not

12069
06:15:40,080 --> 06:15:41,520
how I want to run my business, which is

12070
06:15:41,520 --> 06:15:42,718
the point here, which is you need to

12071
06:15:42,718 --> 06:15:45,680
choose the client size based on your

12072
06:15:45,680 --> 06:15:47,120
goals with the business. I don't want to

12073
06:15:47,120 --> 06:15:49,280
be taking a ton of of sales calls with

12074
06:15:49,280 --> 06:15:51,200
these guys, but my my team would much

12075
06:15:51,200 --> 06:15:53,200
rather be focusing on hey let's build

12076
06:15:53,200 --> 06:15:54,600
one or two really big things

12077
06:15:54,600 --> 06:15:56,718
occasionally rather than doing a sort of

12078
06:15:56,718 --> 06:15:59,120
high frequency style style model here.

12079
06:15:59,120 --> 06:16:01,600
So keep that in mind that the admin you

12080
06:16:01,600 --> 06:16:04,080
will find um there is a certain

12081
06:16:04,080 --> 06:16:05,360
threshold at which you don't want to

12082
06:16:05,360 --> 06:16:06,558
take the project just because you know

12083
06:16:06,558 --> 06:16:08,718
how much admin is involved. Um so yeah

12084
06:16:08,718 --> 06:16:09,600
that's the last thing I wanted to

12085
06:16:09,600 --> 06:16:10,798
mention but that's all for the video.

12086
06:16:10,798 --> 06:16:12,400
Um, if you've liked and you like seeing

12087
06:16:12,400 --> 06:16:14,798
me walk around here in a in a singlet,

12088
06:16:14,798 --> 06:16:16,080
um, you can leave a like down below and

12089
06:16:16,080 --> 06:16:17,520
let me know. Also from my drawings as

12090
06:16:17,520 --> 06:16:18,798
well. So, that's all the video. Thanks

12091
06:16:18,798 --> 06:16:19,760
for watching and I'll see you in the

12092
06:16:19,760 --> 06:16:21,840
next

12093
06:16:22,600 --> 06:16:25,120
one. In this video, I'm continuing on

12094
06:16:25,120 --> 06:16:26,558
from where I left off on my general

12095
06:16:26,558 --> 06:16:28,160
versus niched agencies video. This is

12096
06:16:28,160 --> 06:16:29,200
based around the difference between

12097
06:16:29,200 --> 06:16:31,120
niched and general agencies and how you

12098
06:16:31,120 --> 06:16:33,040
can use this difficulty value matrix to

12099
06:16:33,040 --> 06:16:35,040
decide when to transition from general

12100
06:16:35,040 --> 06:16:36,798
to niched agencies. There's a lot to get

12101
06:16:36,798 --> 06:16:38,400
through. It's very important if you are

12102
06:16:38,400 --> 06:16:39,920
looking to be in this business model

12103
06:16:39,920 --> 06:16:41,520
long term and you're looking to optimize

12104
06:16:41,520 --> 06:16:43,200
how you build your business over time so

12105
06:16:43,200 --> 06:16:44,480
that you can scale it as easy as

12106
06:16:44,480 --> 06:16:46,798
possible. So the difficulty value matrix

12107
06:16:46,798 --> 06:16:47,920
is where we're going to start here. Oh,

12108
06:16:47,920 --> 06:16:49,840
and it is freezing cold here in South

12109
06:16:49,840 --> 06:16:51,600
Africa. So I am wearing a a hoodie. It's

12110
06:16:51,600 --> 06:16:53,200
a little bit more casual than usual, but

12111
06:16:53,200 --> 06:16:54,718
I'm sure you guys will appreciate the

12112
06:16:54,718 --> 06:16:57,440
value rather than the uh attire. So

12113
06:16:57,440 --> 06:16:59,440
let's get into things. So first thing we

12114
06:16:59,440 --> 06:17:02,000
need to go through is a little graph

12115
06:17:02,000 --> 06:17:04,160
like

12116
06:17:04,280 --> 06:17:07,480
this. All right. All right. So up

12117
06:17:07,480 --> 06:17:11,680
here, all right, and up here we

12118
06:17:12,920 --> 06:17:15,798
have

12119
06:17:15,798 --> 06:17:17,718
50K,

12120
06:17:17,718 --> 06:17:21,400
100K, and say this is

12121
06:17:21,400 --> 06:17:25,280
300K and this is monthly rev. So we have

12122
06:17:25,280 --> 06:17:27,600
monthly revenue of 10K, 50K, 100K, and

12123
06:17:27,600 --> 06:17:30,160
300,000. Now this is not retainer income

12124
06:17:30,160 --> 06:17:31,920
um necessarily. It's just the amount of

12125
06:17:31,920 --> 06:17:33,200
cash collected each month that you're

12126
06:17:33,200 --> 06:17:34,878
doing. And we have option number one

12127
06:17:34,878 --> 06:17:37,840
here which is the niched

12128
06:17:38,840 --> 06:17:42,958
agency niched and here we have

12129
06:17:43,480 --> 06:17:46,638
general. So this is step one um is

12130
06:17:46,638 --> 06:17:47,920
understanding the difference between the

12131
06:17:47,920 --> 06:17:49,600
two models and when you should pick one,

12132
06:17:49,600 --> 06:17:50,638
when you should pick the other and when

12133
06:17:50,638 --> 06:17:52,400
you should look to transition your

12134
06:17:52,400 --> 06:17:54,480
general agency into a niche agency.

12135
06:17:54,480 --> 06:17:55,840
Because if we're looking to scale, which

12136
06:17:55,840 --> 06:17:57,440
we're going to get to in a second, the

12137
06:17:57,440 --> 06:18:00,718
niche agency is superior in terms of

12138
06:18:00,718 --> 06:18:02,480
scaling. operationally, you are going to

12139
06:18:02,480 --> 06:18:04,160
be running into less issues. You've got

12140
06:18:04,160 --> 06:18:05,840
less complexity throughout the business.

12141
06:18:05,840 --> 06:18:06,958
You're going to be selling the same

12142
06:18:06,958 --> 06:18:08,480
thing to roughly the same set of people

12143
06:18:08,480 --> 06:18:09,760
over and over and over again. So, it

12144
06:18:09,760 --> 06:18:11,680
makes it much easier to repeatedly sell

12145
06:18:11,680 --> 06:18:13,040
that thing and dial in your marketing

12146
06:18:13,040 --> 06:18:14,798
and your messaging over time, start

12147
06:18:14,798 --> 06:18:17,440
running ads, etc. So, scalability. The

12148
06:18:17,440 --> 06:18:20,400
niche agency has the the crown here um

12149
06:18:20,400 --> 06:18:22,160
as you'd expect. Uh but the general

12150
06:18:22,160 --> 06:18:23,520
agency is where most of you are going to

12151
06:18:23,520 --> 06:18:25,280
be starting. The niche agency is only

12152
06:18:25,280 --> 06:18:27,280
really ideal for people starting out who

12153
06:18:27,280 --> 06:18:29,600
have connections or experience in a

12154
06:18:29,600 --> 06:18:30,878
given industry. So if you have

12155
06:18:30,878 --> 06:18:33,680
connections in say the home services

12156
06:18:33,680 --> 06:18:35,520
industry and you have experience and you

12157
06:18:35,520 --> 06:18:37,360
deeply understand exactly how those

12158
06:18:37,360 --> 06:18:38,558
businesses run and the problems that

12159
06:18:38,558 --> 06:18:40,240
they face then you can go in and either

12160
06:18:40,240 --> 06:18:41,760
use your own experience to identify a

12161
06:18:41,760 --> 06:18:44,000
niche solution and build that out. Maybe

12162
06:18:44,000 --> 06:18:45,760
hire a development team or try to build

12163
06:18:45,760 --> 06:18:47,680
it out yourself or you have your own

12164
06:18:47,680 --> 06:18:49,360
experience from working in that industry

12165
06:18:49,360 --> 06:18:50,400
and you know everything and you don't

12166
06:18:50,400 --> 06:18:52,080
need to go to anyone else. But also the

12167
06:18:52,080 --> 06:18:53,120
connections are going to be helpful

12168
06:18:53,120 --> 06:18:54,480
because you can then go and sell it to

12169
06:18:54,480 --> 06:18:56,240
business owners in that space using your

12170
06:18:56,240 --> 06:18:58,558
warm connection. So niche agency because

12171
06:18:58,558 --> 06:19:00,000
you have to come up with a product or a

12172
06:19:00,000 --> 06:19:02,638
service and an offer initially. It's a

12173
06:19:02,638 --> 06:19:05,040
lot hard to start as a beginner. Um but

12174
06:19:05,040 --> 06:19:06,638
longterm it is superior if you're

12175
06:19:06,638 --> 06:19:08,798
looking to scale aggressively. Right? So

12176
06:19:08,798 --> 06:19:10,320
the general agency which is what most

12177
06:19:10,320 --> 06:19:11,600
you're going to start which means you

12178
06:19:11,600 --> 06:19:12,718
don't need connections. You don't need

12179
06:19:12,718 --> 06:19:15,120
experience. This is kind of a a longer

12180
06:19:15,120 --> 06:19:17,840
process to get started but it's a it's a

12181
06:19:17,840 --> 06:19:19,600
way to ease into the model and ease into

12182
06:19:19,600 --> 06:19:20,878
running online businesses. I know many

12183
06:19:20,878 --> 06:19:22,718
of you are new to online business in

12184
06:19:22,718 --> 06:19:24,878
general. and easing into it. It took me

12185
06:19:24,878 --> 06:19:26,558
14 months to make my first dollar in

12186
06:19:26,558 --> 06:19:27,920
profit when I was doing online business

12187
06:19:27,920 --> 06:19:29,680
in the e-commerce space. And that was

12188
06:19:29,680 --> 06:19:31,200
because I had to ease in and pick up all

12189
06:19:31,200 --> 06:19:32,878
these other skills that are necessary to

12190
06:19:32,878 --> 06:19:34,638
actually succeed. It's it's also it's

12191
06:19:34,638 --> 06:19:36,240
mindset, it's habits, it's there's a

12192
06:19:36,240 --> 06:19:37,440
complete transformation of you that

12193
06:19:37,440 --> 06:19:39,200
needs to happen. And the general agency

12194
06:19:39,200 --> 06:19:40,878
is a way that you can ease into it uh

12195
06:19:40,878 --> 06:19:42,558
without having to go through all the all

12196
06:19:42,558 --> 06:19:43,920
the difficulty of coming up with an

12197
06:19:43,920 --> 06:19:46,240
offer, identifying a problem to solve

12198
06:19:46,240 --> 06:19:48,558
etc. So general agency is where most of

12199
06:19:48,558 --> 06:19:50,638
you are going to be starting. Um, but

12200
06:19:50,638 --> 06:19:52,400
that is not where if you are looking to

12201
06:19:52,400 --> 06:19:53,520
scale, which is the whole purpose of

12202
06:19:53,520 --> 06:19:55,280
this video, you're going to end up

12203
06:19:55,280 --> 06:19:57,520
longterm. And as I mentioned before, the

12204
06:19:57,520 --> 06:19:59,280
operational streamlining that you can

12205
06:19:59,280 --> 06:20:00,638
have from a niche agency where it's

12206
06:20:00,638 --> 06:20:02,798
like, okay, we have built this one this

12207
06:20:02,798 --> 06:20:04,878
one product or the suite of products for

12208
06:20:04,878 --> 06:20:07,600
a certain niche or for a certain avatar,

12209
06:20:07,600 --> 06:20:09,040
it's much easier for us to sell that

12210
06:20:09,040 --> 06:20:10,718
repeatedly and also to acquire customers

12211
06:20:10,718 --> 06:20:12,718
because we can run ads etc. Gone in

12212
06:20:12,718 --> 06:20:14,638
circles here, but you get the idea. The

12213
06:20:14,638 --> 06:20:17,840
point of this video is to give you a

12214
06:20:17,840 --> 06:20:19,840
framework, the difficulty value matrix

12215
06:20:19,840 --> 06:20:22,320
to let you know when to transition this

12216
06:20:22,320 --> 06:20:24,400
general agency into a niche agency.

12217
06:20:24,400 --> 06:20:25,440
Because the good thing about a general

12218
06:20:25,440 --> 06:20:27,440
agency is because you are working uh

12219
06:20:27,440 --> 06:20:29,040
with a various different types of

12220
06:20:29,040 --> 06:20:30,400
companies. You're taking requests on

12221
06:20:30,400 --> 06:20:31,440
things that they want you to build for

12222
06:20:31,440 --> 06:20:33,200
them like Morningside AI, my own

12223
06:20:33,200 --> 06:20:35,520
company. We are in the process, the

12224
06:20:35,520 --> 06:20:36,638
reason I'm making this video is because

12225
06:20:36,638 --> 06:20:38,878
we're in the process of doing this right

12226
06:20:38,878 --> 06:20:41,040
now. So, we are looking to we've been

12227
06:20:41,040 --> 06:20:43,520
trying to scale the general agency which

12228
06:20:43,520 --> 06:20:45,840
is taking custom projects past six

12229
06:20:45,840 --> 06:20:47,200
figures per month and it has just been

12230
06:20:47,200 --> 06:20:48,798
an absolute nightmare. Like it is

12231
06:20:48,798 --> 06:20:50,558
pushing [ __ ] uphill because there's so

12232
06:20:50,558 --> 06:20:52,718
much operational complexity of running

12233
06:20:52,718 --> 06:20:54,480
these custom projects every time because

12234
06:20:54,480 --> 06:20:55,680
every time we go to take on a client,

12235
06:20:55,680 --> 06:20:57,520
there's this gigantic process. There's a

12236
06:20:57,520 --> 06:20:58,798
lot of exploration. We need to do an

12237
06:20:58,798 --> 06:21:00,718
entire exploration milestone with them.

12238
06:21:00,718 --> 06:21:02,000
That's going to take a week. Then we

12239
06:21:02,000 --> 06:21:03,600
need to hop on do a proposal, write the

12240
06:21:03,600 --> 06:21:05,120
whole proposal up, do the contracting,

12241
06:21:05,120 --> 06:21:06,718
custom every time, go back and forth on

12242
06:21:06,718 --> 06:21:08,878
the contract. A lot of stuff goes on

12243
06:21:08,878 --> 06:21:10,798
just to get one client signed because

12244
06:21:10,798 --> 06:21:12,240
there's so much. It's custom. We're

12245
06:21:12,240 --> 06:21:13,840
doing custom development. They do it on

12246
06:21:13,840 --> 06:21:15,120
request. They come to us with something

12247
06:21:15,120 --> 06:21:16,240
that they need. They've watched one of

12248
06:21:16,240 --> 06:21:17,600
my videos where they've seen something

12249
06:21:17,600 --> 06:21:19,040
elsewhere and they come to us and say,

12250
06:21:19,040 --> 06:21:20,320
"Hey, can you build this for me? I'd

12251
06:21:20,320 --> 06:21:22,320
like a I'd like a quote or proposal."

12252
06:21:22,320 --> 06:21:24,480
So, and then because every time you go

12253
06:21:24,480 --> 06:21:26,638
to build a a project as a custom AI

12254
06:21:26,638 --> 06:21:28,360
solutions company like

12255
06:21:28,360 --> 06:21:30,320
Morningside, we are solving problems

12256
06:21:30,320 --> 06:21:31,520
that we potentially haven't solved

12257
06:21:31,520 --> 06:21:34,638
before. So we have a a a track record of

12258
06:21:34,638 --> 06:21:36,000
previous projects we've done and we can

12259
06:21:36,000 --> 06:21:38,000
draw from that how we can execute on

12260
06:21:38,000 --> 06:21:40,240
these new ones but at the end of the day

12261
06:21:40,240 --> 06:21:42,000
we haven't covered even a fraction of

12262
06:21:42,000 --> 06:21:43,760
the potential use cases out there. And

12263
06:21:43,760 --> 06:21:45,120
so for us every time we go into a

12264
06:21:45,120 --> 06:21:46,320
project we are dealing with an element

12265
06:21:46,320 --> 06:21:48,638
of unknown and that means there's a a a

12266
06:21:48,638 --> 06:21:49,840
risk factor that there's going to be

12267
06:21:49,840 --> 06:21:51,280
issues that pop up in the project that's

12268
06:21:51,280 --> 06:21:52,638
going to take longer than expected.

12269
06:21:52,638 --> 06:21:54,160
There's more managerial insight

12270
06:21:54,160 --> 06:21:56,400
involved. Um and so it's difficult has

12271
06:21:56,400 --> 06:21:57,760
been difficult for us to get past this

12272
06:21:57,760 --> 06:22:00,400
this 100k per month mark. So, we are in

12273
06:22:00,400 --> 06:22:02,638
the process of niching down Morning

12274
06:22:02,638 --> 06:22:03,840
Side. This is a little bit of an

12275
06:22:03,840 --> 06:22:04,878
announcement. I'm going to do a whole

12276
06:22:04,878 --> 06:22:06,240
video on it. But, we're in the process

12277
06:22:06,240 --> 06:22:08,080
of niching niching Morning Side down

12278
06:22:08,080 --> 06:22:09,600
into a specific niche. I'm not going to

12279
06:22:09,600 --> 06:22:10,638
tell you just yet. You got to wait for

12280
06:22:10,638 --> 06:22:12,638
that video. But, we're going to niche

12281
06:22:12,638 --> 06:22:15,200
down to scale past that six figure per

12282
06:22:15,200 --> 06:22:16,958
month or low six figure per month cap

12283
06:22:16,958 --> 06:22:18,240
that we've been facing. So, for those of

12284
06:22:18,240 --> 06:22:19,520
you who are starting off agencies, I

12285
06:22:19,520 --> 06:22:20,718
want you to get this very clear in your

12286
06:22:20,718 --> 06:22:22,160
mind right now. Even if you're just

12287
06:22:22,160 --> 06:22:23,760
starting, even if you haven't started,

12288
06:22:23,760 --> 06:22:25,520
understand that this dynamic is at play

12289
06:22:25,520 --> 06:22:27,600
where niche agencies can sort of scale

12290
06:22:27,600 --> 06:22:28,798
right through because they get to all

12291
06:22:28,798 --> 06:22:30,718
the hard work early. General agencies

12292
06:22:30,718 --> 06:22:32,080
get the taste all the way along. So,

12293
06:22:32,080 --> 06:22:33,600
they're doing little all these different

12294
06:22:33,600 --> 06:22:35,558
projects that you do at the

12295
06:22:35,558 --> 06:22:37,600
time. At some point, you're going to

12296
06:22:37,600 --> 06:22:38,878
find something that's going to allow you

12297
06:22:38,878 --> 06:22:40,798
to niche down. And that's what the next

12298
06:22:40,798 --> 06:22:42,160
part of this video is about is how do

12299
06:22:42,160 --> 06:22:44,160
you know when you've found that? So,

12300
06:22:44,160 --> 06:22:46,718
let's go into the next part now. So

12301
06:22:46,718 --> 06:22:48,400
there we have the difficulty value

12302
06:22:48,400 --> 06:22:49,760
matrix, a framework that I've come up

12303
06:22:49,760 --> 06:22:51,600
with for looking at the solutions that

12304
06:22:51,600 --> 06:22:53,680
you provide as a general agency that you

12305
06:22:53,680 --> 06:22:56,240
can pass through this this as a as a

12306
06:22:56,240 --> 06:22:58,798
filter or as a lens uh to determine if

12307
06:22:58,798 --> 06:23:00,240
the solution that you're providing is

12308
06:23:00,240 --> 06:23:01,920
something that's potentially an option

12309
06:23:01,920 --> 06:23:04,400
for niching down towards. So I know it's

12310
06:23:04,400 --> 06:23:05,600
probably not rocket science, but we have

12311
06:23:05,600 --> 06:23:06,958
value along the bottom in terms of the

12312
06:23:06,958 --> 06:23:09,040
value to the client. So if you create

12313
06:23:09,040 --> 06:23:10,400
something inherently the solutions that

12314
06:23:10,400 --> 06:23:12,320
we build, our whole job as AI automation

12315
06:23:12,320 --> 06:23:14,240
agency owners is to be able to use AI

12316
06:23:14,240 --> 06:23:15,600
technology to create value in

12317
06:23:15,600 --> 06:23:17,360
businesses. So that's our skill. We need

12318
06:23:17,360 --> 06:23:18,878
to identify opportunities for it. And

12319
06:23:18,878 --> 06:23:20,798
then we need to deploy the resources and

12320
06:23:20,798 --> 06:23:23,200
the team necessary and have the

12321
06:23:23,200 --> 06:23:25,440
managerial oversight to see that uh that

12322
06:23:25,440 --> 06:23:27,280
project delivered and and executed so

12323
06:23:27,280 --> 06:23:28,558
that we can create value for their

12324
06:23:28,558 --> 06:23:29,600
businesses. And we're going to be able

12325
06:23:29,600 --> 06:23:30,878
to extract some of that value back for

12326
06:23:30,878 --> 06:23:32,400
ourselves in the process of creating it.

12327
06:23:32,400 --> 06:23:34,638
So that's how we pull and siphon out

12328
06:23:34,638 --> 06:23:37,120
some money from this AI wave and the AI

12329
06:23:37,120 --> 06:23:38,638
revolution or whatever buzz word you

12330
06:23:38,638 --> 06:23:40,558
want to use. We need to create value

12331
06:23:40,558 --> 06:23:42,480
with AI and we get a share of it of

12332
06:23:42,480 --> 06:23:44,080
whatever we're able to create. So the

12333
06:23:44,080 --> 06:23:45,440
value that we create for clients it can

12334
06:23:45,440 --> 06:23:47,200
either be low and something that's quite

12335
06:23:47,200 --> 06:23:48,798
small and and more of a quality of life

12336
06:23:48,798 --> 06:23:51,280
thing or it can be a serious uh impact

12337
06:23:51,280 --> 06:23:52,718
provide a serious impact to the business

12338
06:23:52,718 --> 06:23:55,280
and drive massive growth or cost savings

12339
06:23:55,280 --> 06:23:57,280
etc. So high value low value not too

12340
06:23:57,280 --> 06:23:59,680
complicated. Then we have difficulty in

12341
06:23:59,680 --> 06:24:00,798
terms of the difficulty for you to

12342
06:24:00,798 --> 06:24:02,240
deliver it. There's low difficulty and

12343
06:24:02,240 --> 06:24:04,638
high difficulty. This might be a little

12344
06:24:04,638 --> 06:24:07,760
automation. This might be a custom

12345
06:24:07,760 --> 06:24:09,840
platform. The the high difficulty ones

12346
06:24:09,840 --> 06:24:11,520
might involve a lot of moving parts and

12347
06:24:11,520 --> 06:24:12,878
different integrations. The low

12348
06:24:12,878 --> 06:24:15,360
difficulty ones might use a very basic

12349
06:24:15,360 --> 06:24:17,200
setup with just one or two software. So

12350
06:24:17,200 --> 06:24:18,718
I know you you guys are smart enough to

12351
06:24:18,718 --> 06:24:20,160
to understand the difference between

12352
06:24:20,160 --> 06:24:22,798
hard and easy projects and also low and

12353
06:24:22,798 --> 06:24:24,480
high value projects. But in the middle

12354
06:24:24,480 --> 06:24:26,320
here is where it gets good and this is

12355
06:24:26,320 --> 06:24:27,760
the lens that you can look through to

12356
06:24:27,760 --> 06:24:28,878
identify what solutions you should

12357
06:24:28,878 --> 06:24:30,320
consider niching down towards. So first

12358
06:24:30,320 --> 06:24:32,160
we have in this bottom corner low value

12359
06:24:32,160 --> 06:24:34,080
solutions. Low value to the client but

12360
06:24:34,080 --> 06:24:35,680
also low difficulty. So it's easy for us

12361
06:24:35,680 --> 06:24:37,440
to deliver but it's not providing that

12362
06:24:37,440 --> 06:24:38,878
much value to the client. These are kind

12363
06:24:38,878 --> 06:24:41,040
of quality of life little they can be

12364
06:24:41,040 --> 06:24:42,798
good for upsells where if you're

12365
06:24:42,798 --> 06:24:44,320
targeting a certain niche, you can say,

12366
06:24:44,320 --> 06:24:45,680
"Hey, look, I'll also throw in this this

12367
06:24:45,680 --> 06:24:47,520
this and this. It's easy for us to do.

12368
06:24:47,520 --> 06:24:49,280
It's like not much not much cost to us,

12369
06:24:49,280 --> 06:24:50,638
but we can throw them in there. It's not

12370
06:24:50,638 --> 06:24:52,000
going to be the main driver of value for

12371
06:24:52,000 --> 06:24:53,440
the offer, but they can be handy things

12372
06:24:53,440 --> 06:24:55,200
to get a deal over the line or just to

12373
06:24:55,200 --> 06:24:56,798
provide some extra value um for the

12374
06:24:56,798 --> 06:24:58,958
client on the whole. So, low value and

12375
06:24:58,958 --> 06:25:00,638
easy. Next, we have solutions that are

12376
06:25:00,638 --> 06:25:02,480
of low value to the client and are hard

12377
06:25:02,480 --> 06:25:04,480
for us to deliver. So, I'm not even

12378
06:25:04,480 --> 06:25:06,400
going to continue talking about that.

12379
06:25:06,400 --> 06:25:07,760
Let's just cross that off. that's not

12380
06:25:07,760 --> 06:25:09,680
what we're interested in here. And if

12381
06:25:09,680 --> 06:25:10,718
you've delivered one of these, you

12382
06:25:10,718 --> 06:25:12,080
probably want to put that on a blacklist

12383
06:25:12,080 --> 06:25:14,400
of like, let's never do this again. Um

12384
06:25:14,400 --> 06:25:16,958
cuz providing not much value to your

12385
06:25:16,958 --> 06:25:18,480
client and making it very hard for

12386
06:25:18,480 --> 06:25:20,160
yourself and your team is not the

12387
06:25:20,160 --> 06:25:21,520
equation that we want out of these

12388
06:25:21,520 --> 06:25:23,040
businesses, right? Personally, I'm

12389
06:25:23,040 --> 06:25:24,320
trying to build a business that is it's

12390
06:25:24,320 --> 06:25:25,680
to some degree a lifestyle business as

12391
06:25:25,680 --> 06:25:27,360
well that allows me to live the life

12392
06:25:27,360 --> 06:25:28,878
that I want to. And if I'm taking on a

12393
06:25:28,878 --> 06:25:30,400
bunch of stress, stressing my team out

12394
06:25:30,400 --> 06:25:32,240
and not delivering much value, I can put

12395
06:25:32,240 --> 06:25:34,638
my time in in I should be spending my

12396
06:25:34,638 --> 06:25:36,480
time on different areas of this quadrant

12397
06:25:36,480 --> 06:25:38,480
uh in future. So jumping across to here,

12398
06:25:38,480 --> 06:25:41,120
we have high value and hard solutions.

12399
06:25:41,120 --> 06:25:42,878
So these are these custom platforms that

12400
06:25:42,878 --> 06:25:44,080
you have to put a lot of effort into.

12401
06:25:44,080 --> 06:25:45,680
Like the biggest project that we've done

12402
06:25:45,680 --> 06:25:48,718
at Morningside is now uh over $120,000

12403
06:25:48,718 --> 06:25:52,160
or so. Um and it was a a complete SAS AI

12404
06:25:52,160 --> 06:25:53,840
SAS buildout that we've done that was

12405
06:25:53,840 --> 06:25:55,920
both high value for the client and also

12406
06:25:55,920 --> 06:25:57,280
very hard for the team. So there was the

12407
06:25:57,280 --> 06:25:58,400
most difficult project we've done by

12408
06:25:58,400 --> 06:25:59,840
far. It took basically all of our

12409
06:25:59,840 --> 06:26:01,840
resources for a while, but we're able to

12410
06:26:01,840 --> 06:26:03,200
deliver that. And so while these can be

12411
06:26:03,200 --> 06:26:04,638
good at certain stages of your general

12412
06:26:04,638 --> 06:26:06,558
agency, it's likely not something that

12413
06:26:06,558 --> 06:26:08,400
you want to niche your agency down to

12414
06:26:08,400 --> 06:26:09,920
unless you want to end up like in our

12415
06:26:09,920 --> 06:26:13,200
case being like the AI SAS specialists.

12416
06:26:13,200 --> 06:26:14,240
Personally, I wouldn't be trying to

12417
06:26:14,240 --> 06:26:15,600
niche down to it. And that's why us as

12418
06:26:15,600 --> 06:26:17,520
Morningside didn't we did consider it of

12419
06:26:17,520 --> 06:26:19,040
saying, "Hey, let's just keep doing AI

12420
06:26:19,040 --> 06:26:20,480
SAS projects cuz they're quite large.

12421
06:26:20,480 --> 06:26:22,080
They're high ticket and we can get a

12422
06:26:22,080 --> 06:26:23,600
nice track record up of like clear

12423
06:26:23,600 --> 06:26:25,440
definable platforms that we built." But

12424
06:26:25,440 --> 06:26:27,600
on the whole, we weren't interested in

12425
06:26:27,600 --> 06:26:29,200
doing that. We're looking for a sort of

12426
06:26:29,200 --> 06:26:30,638
smaller win that we can scale a bit more

12427
06:26:30,638 --> 06:26:32,638
aggressively because this hard we are in

12428
06:26:32,638 --> 06:26:34,080
a stage with the AI space right now

12429
06:26:34,080 --> 06:26:37,520
where we have the luxury of being early.

12430
06:26:37,520 --> 06:26:39,840
We don't have to at at a at a later date

12431
06:26:39,840 --> 06:26:41,120
people are going to solve these problems

12432
06:26:41,120 --> 06:26:43,360
because hard hard is all was all kind of

12433
06:26:43,360 --> 06:26:45,200
relative, right? People can solve hard

12434
06:26:45,200 --> 06:26:47,200
with good systems and good processes and

12435
06:26:47,200 --> 06:26:49,040
really talented teams. So hard can

12436
06:26:49,040 --> 06:26:50,920
eventually become like

12437
06:26:50,920 --> 06:26:53,200
medium if you've done the same thing

12438
06:26:53,200 --> 06:26:54,638
like 20 times and you've really dialed

12439
06:26:54,638 --> 06:26:56,400
in the process on how you execute on

12440
06:26:56,400 --> 06:26:58,240
delivering an AI SAS platform. But on

12441
06:26:58,240 --> 06:26:59,840
the whole we are in the early stages of

12442
06:26:59,840 --> 06:27:02,320
this AI revolution and we have the

12443
06:27:02,320 --> 06:27:04,558
luxury of picking the lowhanging fruit.

12444
06:27:04,558 --> 06:27:06,320
So you watching this video right now as

12445
06:27:06,320 --> 06:27:08,160
opposing you have the luxury of picking

12446
06:27:08,160 --> 06:27:10,558
a lowhanging fruit that are easy to

12447
06:27:10,558 --> 06:27:12,478
deliver and high value which is our next

12448
06:27:12,478 --> 06:27:14,320
one. So this is not a complete no.

12449
06:27:14,320 --> 06:27:16,320
Neither is this, but this is high value

12450
06:27:16,320 --> 06:27:18,000
to the client plus easy to deliver,

12451
06:27:18,000 --> 06:27:21,520
which is a big big check mark from uh

12452
06:27:21,520 --> 06:27:23,600
Mr. Mr. Otley here. So that is exactly

12453
06:27:23,600 --> 06:27:25,120
what we're trying to go for. If you are

12454
06:27:25,120 --> 06:27:26,558
niching down to a specific type of

12455
06:27:26,558 --> 06:27:27,440
solution that you want to sell

12456
06:27:27,440 --> 06:27:28,798
repeatedly, for example, you may have

12457
06:27:28,798 --> 06:27:30,638
found an automation or a chain of AI

12458
06:27:30,638 --> 06:27:32,558
automations that when applied to a

12459
06:27:32,558 --> 06:27:34,320
specific type of business can completely

12460
06:27:34,320 --> 06:27:35,680
change the the way that they are

12461
06:27:35,680 --> 06:27:37,440
acquiring clients. And that's a massive

12462
06:27:37,440 --> 06:27:39,200
value ad for the client, but also easier

12463
06:27:39,200 --> 06:27:41,440
for you. In some cases, the strengths of

12464
06:27:41,440 --> 06:27:43,200
generative AI and LLM can just be

12465
06:27:43,200 --> 06:27:46,240
applied perfectly to a specific use case

12466
06:27:46,240 --> 06:27:48,478
and you're able to get a a situation

12467
06:27:48,478 --> 06:27:49,840
like this where high value to the client

12468
06:27:49,840 --> 06:27:51,600
and easy for you to deliver. So, if we

12469
06:27:51,600 --> 06:27:53,200
are talking about when to go from niche

12470
06:27:53,200 --> 06:27:55,360
to general and you remember on the uh

12471
06:27:55,360 --> 06:27:57,920
the little thing I had all these lines

12472
06:27:57,920 --> 06:27:59,680
and then what's this big star moment

12473
06:27:59,680 --> 06:28:01,280
where we're going to actually go up to

12474
06:28:01,280 --> 06:28:03,520
the niched route. This is what you're

12475
06:28:03,520 --> 06:28:04,878
looking for. This is the lens, the high

12476
06:28:04,878 --> 06:28:06,320
value and easy to deliver. So, just to

12477
06:28:06,320 --> 06:28:08,080
recap, high value and easy is what we're

12478
06:28:08,080 --> 06:28:09,840
looking for. Low value and easy are good

12479
06:28:09,840 --> 06:28:12,520
for upsells

12480
06:28:12,520 --> 06:28:14,240
slashbundles. So, not something you

12481
06:28:14,240 --> 06:28:15,680
should completely disregard, but keep

12482
06:28:15,680 --> 06:28:17,120
them in the back pocket if you want to

12483
06:28:17,120 --> 06:28:18,798
add more value to a deal or offer them

12484
06:28:18,798 --> 06:28:20,798
to your client as a as an extra. Um,

12485
06:28:20,798 --> 06:28:22,878
high value and hard can be good. Um, and

12486
06:28:22,878 --> 06:28:24,638
you can turn this hard into medium over

12487
06:28:24,638 --> 06:28:27,200
time. Um, but we are in the early stages

12488
06:28:27,200 --> 06:28:28,478
and we get to pick the low hanging

12489
06:28:28,478 --> 06:28:31,280
fruit. Here's a little tree. The low

12490
06:28:31,280 --> 06:28:33,520
hanging fruit is what we're trying to

12491
06:28:33,520 --> 06:28:34,878
get there. And that's what high value

12492
06:28:34,878 --> 06:28:36,878
and easy to deliver solutions are. So

12493
06:28:36,878 --> 06:28:38,320
moving on from that, I want to point out

12494
06:28:38,320 --> 06:28:39,680
also something that you may not be aware

12495
06:28:39,680 --> 06:28:41,360
of when you are building these solutions

12496
06:28:41,360 --> 06:28:43,200
and and working as a general agency in

12497
06:28:43,200 --> 06:28:45,440
particular. uh there is no contractual

12498
06:28:45,440 --> 06:28:47,280
obligation unless you put it in the

12499
06:28:47,280 --> 06:28:49,680
contract that if you build a high value

12500
06:28:49,680 --> 06:28:51,120
and easy to deliver solution for a

12501
06:28:51,120 --> 06:28:53,080
client that you can't go and then take

12502
06:28:53,080 --> 06:28:56,680
this and go okay

12503
06:28:56,680 --> 06:28:58,360
how

12504
06:28:58,360 --> 06:28:59,958
can

12505
06:28:59,958 --> 06:29:02,520
I

12506
06:29:02,520 --> 06:29:05,240
find

12507
06:29:05,240 --> 06:29:07,680
more businesses so you've delivered a

12508
06:29:07,680 --> 06:29:09,360
high value and easy to deliver solution

12509
06:29:09,360 --> 06:29:11,760
for a specific type of business you

12510
06:29:11,760 --> 06:29:13,120
should be asking next if you're choosing

12511
06:29:13,120 --> 06:29:14,878
to niche down here or want to explore it

12512
06:29:14,878 --> 06:29:16,558
further, do a couple more iterations and

12513
06:29:16,558 --> 06:29:18,080
and implement it in businesses a few

12514
06:29:18,080 --> 06:29:19,120
more times and get a bit more

12515
06:29:19,120 --> 06:29:20,958
experience. Your question should be, how

12516
06:29:20,958 --> 06:29:22,638
can I find more of these businesses?

12517
06:29:22,638 --> 06:29:23,920
Because what you've just built here,

12518
06:29:23,920 --> 06:29:25,840
unless in the contract with the client,

12519
06:29:25,840 --> 06:29:28,240
they ask for exclusivity where if you

12520
06:29:28,240 --> 06:29:29,600
build this for me, you're not allowed to

12521
06:29:29,600 --> 06:29:30,958
build it for any of my competitors or

12522
06:29:30,958 --> 06:29:32,958
anyone else in the space. And for them

12523
06:29:32,958 --> 06:29:34,878
to ask for that on the in the contract,

12524
06:29:34,878 --> 06:29:36,000
you will need to put your price

12525
06:29:36,000 --> 06:29:37,520
significantly up because if in most

12526
06:29:37,520 --> 06:29:39,280
cases, AI is quite a broad field right

12527
06:29:39,280 --> 06:29:40,400
now. There's a lot of overlapping

12528
06:29:40,400 --> 06:29:41,920
solutions. It might be an AI automation,

12529
06:29:41,920 --> 06:29:43,760
it might be a chatbot. If you as an

12530
06:29:43,760 --> 06:29:45,600
agency say, "I will never build another

12531
06:29:45,600 --> 06:29:48,240
AI chatbot for this," you're wiping out

12532
06:29:48,240 --> 06:29:49,600
a massive potential chunk of revenue for

12533
06:29:49,600 --> 06:29:51,360
the foreseeable future. So, in unless

12534
06:29:51,360 --> 06:29:53,520
they're willing to pay five, six, 10

12535
06:29:53,520 --> 06:29:55,200
times more than what you actually put on

12536
06:29:55,200 --> 06:29:56,878
the regular ticket price for a project

12537
06:29:56,878 --> 06:29:58,718
like that, you're entirely allowed to

12538
06:29:58,718 --> 06:30:00,160
take that exact same solution that you

12539
06:30:00,160 --> 06:30:01,520
built for them and then go and find

12540
06:30:01,520 --> 06:30:03,280
other people like it. You go on Apollo,

12541
06:30:03,280 --> 06:30:04,958
you go on use instantly's lead finder,

12542
06:30:04,958 --> 06:30:06,240
you go on any of these lead finding

12543
06:30:06,240 --> 06:30:07,680
platforms, you go on LinkedIn Sales

12544
06:30:07,680 --> 06:30:09,760
Navigator, you can try to find other

12545
06:30:09,760 --> 06:30:11,120
business owners like that using any of

12546
06:30:11,120 --> 06:30:12,478
the lead generation methods that are out

12547
06:30:12,478 --> 06:30:13,760
there, right? And then once you take

12548
06:30:13,760 --> 06:30:15,520
that, you've already got it built. Now

12549
06:30:15,520 --> 06:30:17,360
you can just try and copy and paste it

12550
06:30:17,360 --> 06:30:18,400
to some degree. There's always going to

12551
06:30:18,400 --> 06:30:20,160
be some complexities and replicating it

12552
06:30:20,160 --> 06:30:21,760
across to another business, but for the

12553
06:30:21,760 --> 06:30:23,520
most part, you've got a significant

12554
06:30:23,520 --> 06:30:25,040
chunk of it done and now you're able to

12555
06:30:25,040 --> 06:30:26,798
take it across. So these businesses that

12556
06:30:26,798 --> 06:30:28,558
you work with, unless they ask for it

12557
06:30:28,558 --> 06:30:30,080
explicitly in the contract, you are able

12558
06:30:30,080 --> 06:30:31,440
to go and find more businesses like

12559
06:30:31,440 --> 06:30:33,680
them. And then you have the ammunition

12560
06:30:33,680 --> 06:30:35,718
required to

12561
06:30:35,718 --> 06:30:37,478
say

12562
06:30:37,478 --> 06:30:39,718
I

12563
06:30:39,718 --> 06:30:43,958
built X for

12564
06:30:43,958 --> 06:30:47,120
Y. Do you want it? And then once you do

12565
06:30:47,120 --> 06:30:48,558
this, you have the ammunition when you

12566
06:30:48,558 --> 06:30:50,080
are reaching out to them to make your

12567
06:30:50,080 --> 06:30:51,840
outreach so much more effective because

12568
06:30:51,840 --> 06:30:54,320
you can say, "Hey, I just built X for Y,

12569
06:30:54,320 --> 06:30:56,160
your competitor. Are you interested in

12570
06:30:56,160 --> 06:30:57,760
learning more about it or do you want to

12571
06:30:57,760 --> 06:30:59,440
hop on a call to discuss how it could

12572
06:30:59,440 --> 06:31:01,360
change your business as well?" This is

12573
06:31:01,360 --> 06:31:04,080
tapping into a the sort of psychology of

12574
06:31:04,080 --> 06:31:05,520
business owners right now where they

12575
06:31:05,520 --> 06:31:07,520
know AI is is the wave. It's coming.

12576
06:31:07,520 --> 06:31:08,798
Many of them are skeptical about it.

12577
06:31:08,798 --> 06:31:10,320
They're not ready to invest in it, but

12578
06:31:10,320 --> 06:31:11,680
this is the kind of thing that can nudge

12579
06:31:11,680 --> 06:31:13,760
them over the edge. So being able to say

12580
06:31:13,760 --> 06:31:15,840
that, hey, your direct competitor, I

12581
06:31:15,840 --> 06:31:17,840
just built this crazy AI system for them

12582
06:31:17,840 --> 06:31:19,520
and it's getting insane results for

12583
06:31:19,520 --> 06:31:21,120
them. Would you be interested in hopping

12584
06:31:21,120 --> 06:31:22,320
on a call to learn more about how it

12585
06:31:22,320 --> 06:31:23,600
could potentially help your business? If

12586
06:31:23,600 --> 06:31:25,600
not, uh if it's not a good good fit, no

12587
06:31:25,600 --> 06:31:26,638
problem. But you've just learned a bit

12588
06:31:26,638 --> 06:31:28,240
more about how AI is helping businesses

12589
06:31:28,240 --> 06:31:31,120
in your industry. So I want to link this

12590
06:31:31,120 --> 06:31:32,878
very quickly to some of the the research

12591
06:31:32,878 --> 06:31:35,520
that I've been doing. I'm always uh

12592
06:31:35,520 --> 06:31:37,920
furiously researching the macro

12593
06:31:37,920 --> 06:31:40,320
environment behind the scenes because if

12594
06:31:40,320 --> 06:31:41,440
I'm going to be giving you guys

12595
06:31:41,440 --> 06:31:42,558
information, I want to make sure that

12596
06:31:42,558 --> 06:31:44,400
I'm giving you relevant information

12597
06:31:44,400 --> 06:31:46,878
given the the macroeconomic context and

12598
06:31:46,878 --> 06:31:48,320
all the trends that are going on. So,

12599
06:31:48,320 --> 06:31:49,600
based off a report that I was reading,

12600
06:31:49,600 --> 06:31:51,120
I'll put it up on screen now so you can

12601
06:31:51,120 --> 06:31:53,040
read it. It says, "The tension between

12602
06:31:53,040 --> 06:31:55,120
the push to offset slowing labor force

12603
06:31:55,120 --> 06:31:56,878
growth with automation and the pull to

12604
06:31:56,878 --> 06:31:58,478
slow automation's rollout to prevent

12605
06:31:58,478 --> 06:31:59,840
massive disruption will play out over

12606
06:31:59,840 --> 06:32:01,920
the next 10 to 20 years. But once the

12607
06:32:01,920 --> 06:32:03,440
first companies begin deploying new

12608
06:32:03,440 --> 06:32:05,440
forms of automation, others are likely

12609
06:32:05,440 --> 06:32:06,878
to rapidly follow suit to stay

12610
06:32:06,878 --> 06:32:09,680
competitive. This ties directly into

12611
06:32:09,680 --> 06:32:10,878
something that I've talked about a lot

12612
06:32:10,878 --> 06:32:13,280
before, which is this tech adoption life

12613
06:32:13,280 --> 06:32:15,400
cycle. So we have bam,

12614
06:32:15,400 --> 06:32:19,040
bam, bam, bam. The tech adoption life

12615
06:32:19,040 --> 06:32:20,638
cycle. Not to hop on about this over and

12616
06:32:20,638 --> 06:32:23,120
over. We have the innovators here. We

12617
06:32:23,120 --> 06:32:24,240
can ignore them. We have the early

12618
06:32:24,240 --> 06:32:25,600
adopters, which is where we're selling

12619
06:32:25,600 --> 06:32:27,200
most of our AI solutions right now. So

12620
06:32:27,200 --> 06:32:29,440
early adopters are this segment here.

12621
06:32:29,440 --> 06:32:31,520
And then we have the early majority

12622
06:32:31,520 --> 06:32:34,000
which is this big chunk here. And then

12623
06:32:34,000 --> 06:32:36,400
we have the late majority which we're

12624
06:32:36,400 --> 06:32:37,920
not too interested in right now. But we

12625
06:32:37,920 --> 06:32:39,520
are in the stage in the AI space right

12626
06:32:39,520 --> 06:32:41,360
now. On the consumer side it's a little

12627
06:32:41,360 --> 06:32:43,040
bit different cuz chat GPT is allowing

12628
06:32:43,040 --> 06:32:44,958
us to the early majority is getting into

12629
06:32:44,958 --> 06:32:46,558
chat GPT right now. But when it comes to

12630
06:32:46,558 --> 06:32:48,478
business adoption of AI solutions, I can

12631
06:32:48,478 --> 06:32:49,920
tell you firsthand and from all the

12632
06:32:49,920 --> 06:32:51,840
thousands of people in my community that

12633
06:32:51,840 --> 06:32:53,920
we're still in this early adopters

12634
06:32:53,920 --> 06:32:55,760
category. And this is what they call the

12635
06:32:55,760 --> 06:32:58,478
the chasm, crossing the chasm. So, I

12636
06:32:58,478 --> 06:32:59,600
didn't really draw it as you would, but

12637
06:32:59,600 --> 06:33:00,798
there's a there's a gap between early

12638
06:33:00,798 --> 06:33:02,798
adoption and early majority. And it's

12639
06:33:02,798 --> 06:33:04,478
the businesses right now who are able to

12640
06:33:04,478 --> 06:33:06,080
jump from these early adopters who many

12641
06:33:06,080 --> 06:33:07,200
of you are probably talking to when

12642
06:33:07,200 --> 06:33:08,558
you're doing your lead generation,

12643
06:33:08,558 --> 06:33:09,920
you're making content, you'll be talking

12644
06:33:09,920 --> 06:33:12,080
to a lot of early adopters in the space,

12645
06:33:12,080 --> 06:33:13,760
who are interested in just trying AI out

12646
06:33:13,760 --> 06:33:15,040
in their business because they know it's

12647
06:33:15,040 --> 06:33:15,920
the future and they're willing to

12648
06:33:15,920 --> 06:33:17,280
experiment and they see where it's going

12649
06:33:17,280 --> 06:33:20,320
to go. They're not as worried in direct

12650
06:33:20,320 --> 06:33:22,320
ROI, but more on just being in the front

12651
06:33:22,320 --> 06:33:23,440
foot. So they will take a bit of their

12652
06:33:23,440 --> 06:33:25,280
profits and reinvest it into AI just

12653
06:33:25,280 --> 06:33:26,798
purely on the potential for what it

12654
06:33:26,798 --> 06:33:28,478
could do for their business long term.

12655
06:33:28,478 --> 06:33:30,958
But this early majority take a lot more

12656
06:33:30,958 --> 06:33:32,240
evidence and data. They're going to wait

12657
06:33:32,240 --> 06:33:34,718
for the early adopters to have a go with

12658
06:33:34,718 --> 06:33:36,080
it. Let me know. I want to see some

12659
06:33:36,080 --> 06:33:37,200
data. I want to see it actually working

12660
06:33:37,200 --> 06:33:38,638
and then I'm going to jump in and start

12661
06:33:38,638 --> 06:33:40,840
using it. So that's what this chasm is.

12662
06:33:40,840 --> 06:33:44,240
And this is the information that allows

12663
06:33:44,240 --> 06:33:46,718
you to start tapping in to this early

12664
06:33:46,718 --> 06:33:48,400
majority. You can say I bought this

12665
06:33:48,400 --> 06:33:50,320
system for your competitor. Do you want

12666
06:33:50,320 --> 06:33:52,638
it? Are you interested in it? he is or

12667
06:33:52,638 --> 06:33:54,638
she is an early adopter. you've sold it

12668
06:33:54,638 --> 06:33:56,478
to this person initially that you've

12669
06:33:56,478 --> 06:33:58,160
used their money basically to build the

12670
06:33:58,160 --> 06:34:00,080
thing out and do all the R&D for it and

12671
06:34:00,080 --> 06:34:02,000
now you can go to these early majority

12672
06:34:02,000 --> 06:34:03,600
and start reaching out to a much broader

12673
06:34:03,600 --> 06:34:04,798
part of the the business owner

12674
06:34:04,798 --> 06:34:06,878
population and start sending this these

12675
06:34:06,878 --> 06:34:08,718
kind of messages where it's hey you are

12676
06:34:08,718 --> 06:34:11,040
in this category and you need

12677
06:34:11,040 --> 06:34:12,478
information like this here's all the

12678
06:34:12,478 --> 06:34:14,400
proof here's how it worked here's a demo

12679
06:34:14,400 --> 06:34:16,080
of it would you be interested and now

12680
06:34:16,080 --> 06:34:17,760
you are able to start tapping into this

12681
06:34:17,760 --> 06:34:20,000
much larger chunk of the business owner

12682
06:34:20,000 --> 06:34:22,400
population or business owner market

12683
06:34:22,400 --> 06:34:24,400
globally wherever you want

12684
06:34:24,400 --> 06:34:27,040
niche that down to. But broadly

12685
06:34:27,040 --> 06:34:28,718
speaking, this section of the early

12686
06:34:28,718 --> 06:34:29,920
majority is what you're able to tap

12687
06:34:29,920 --> 06:34:31,440
into. And that is really what the race

12688
06:34:31,440 --> 06:34:33,120
is on for right now between you, me,

12689
06:34:33,120 --> 06:34:34,638
everyone else in the AI agency space,

12690
06:34:34,638 --> 06:34:36,320
the small group of us that are after

12691
06:34:36,320 --> 06:34:38,240
this opportunity right now. We are

12692
06:34:38,240 --> 06:34:39,680
gunning for this. And so if you're able

12693
06:34:39,680 --> 06:34:41,360
to build a solution for a business that

12694
06:34:41,360 --> 06:34:43,920
is high value and easy to deliver, you

12695
06:34:43,920 --> 06:34:45,280
go and find more businesses like that.

12696
06:34:45,280 --> 06:34:47,120
You start to send messages and let them

12697
06:34:47,120 --> 06:34:48,400
know that, hey, I've built stuff for

12698
06:34:48,400 --> 06:34:49,520
your competitors. Would you be

12699
06:34:49,520 --> 06:34:50,558
interested in learning more about it?

12700
06:34:50,558 --> 06:34:52,240
you are going to see a sizable increase

12701
06:34:52,240 --> 06:34:53,840
in the response rate when you are

12702
06:34:53,840 --> 06:34:55,120
reaching out to businesses. So, I think

12703
06:34:55,120 --> 06:34:56,320
that's all I want to cover for this

12704
06:34:56,320 --> 06:34:57,440
video. I know that's been quite a

12705
06:34:57,440 --> 06:34:58,638
synthesis of all the different stuff

12706
06:34:58,638 --> 06:35:00,000
that I talked about on the channel. But

12707
06:35:00,000 --> 06:35:01,120
if you're new to the channel and you

12708
06:35:01,120 --> 06:35:02,400
don't know who I am or what the hell I'm

12709
06:35:02,400 --> 06:35:03,600
talking about, then go back and watch my

12710
06:35:03,600 --> 06:35:04,718
other videos. There's plenty of stuff on

12711
06:35:04,718 --> 06:35:06,080
the channel talking about this, me in

12712
06:35:06,080 --> 06:35:07,200
front of the whiteboard, waving my hands

12713
06:35:07,200 --> 06:35:08,478
around. But this information is so

12714
06:35:08,478 --> 06:35:09,600
important for you to understand. If you

12715
06:35:09,600 --> 06:35:10,878
are looking to do this longterm and

12716
06:35:10,878 --> 06:35:12,558
scale your agency, as myself and the

12717
06:35:12,558 --> 06:35:13,840
team at Morningside are doing right now,

12718
06:35:13,840 --> 06:35:15,680
we are looking to break past that

12719
06:35:15,680 --> 06:35:17,520
ceiling that we've hit for so long. And

12720
06:35:17,520 --> 06:35:18,958
to do that, we need to niche down. We've

12721
06:35:18,958 --> 06:35:20,240
realized that and this is the way that

12722
06:35:20,240 --> 06:35:21,840
we've done it. I'm just sharing with you

12723
06:35:21,840 --> 06:35:23,600
what we do so that you guys can do it in

12724
06:35:23,600 --> 06:35:24,878
your agency as well and see similar

12725
06:35:24,878 --> 06:35:26,718
success. So, aside from that, if you've

12726
06:35:26,718 --> 06:35:28,400
enjoyed, leave a like. Uh, subscribe to

12727
06:35:28,400 --> 06:35:30,080
the channel for more videos like this

12728
06:35:30,080 --> 06:35:31,680
and leave a comment if there's anything

12729
06:35:31,680 --> 06:35:32,958
that you want me to cover in future. If

12730
06:35:32,958 --> 06:35:34,000
you have any questions about any of

12731
06:35:34,000 --> 06:35:35,200
this, please drop it down below. If

12732
06:35:35,200 --> 06:35:36,718
there's good questions, I will go and

12733
06:35:36,718 --> 06:35:38,160
reply to them. If it's just rubbish,

12734
06:35:38,160 --> 06:35:39,360
then I'm not going to bother replying to

12735
06:35:39,360 --> 06:35:40,478
them, by the way. So, yeah, that's the

12736
06:35:40,478 --> 06:35:42,160
difficulty value matrix. That's all for

12737
06:35:42,160 --> 06:35:46,360
this video. See you in the next one.
