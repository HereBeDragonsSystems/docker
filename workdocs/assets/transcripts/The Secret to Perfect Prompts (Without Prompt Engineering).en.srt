1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,879
I've had many times where I know ChatGpt

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,319
can help me with something, but I can't

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,640
think of the best way to ask. So, I made

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,160
a solution that gives me the perfect

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,080
prompts every time. Another issue I run

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,679
into is trying to get the words right

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,080
for generating images or videos. Maybe I

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,839
know the concept, but not every detail

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,840
or style. Or sometimes I'm just stuck

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
completely. I made a solution for that,

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,279
too. I'll cover how I did it so you can

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,960
create this for yourself, customized

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
exactly how you want. Then, you'll

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
always have the perfect prompt for every

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,560
situation. What we are building here are

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,320
prompt enhancers. I'm going to start

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,159
with text to image and text to video

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,920
because that's just a lot easier. I'll

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,680
cover LLMs after. There's a lot more

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,200
ways to customize that because everyone

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,160
uses them for different

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,800
purposes. Starting with text to image,

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,960
the goal is to be able to input my basic

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640
prompt with whatever details I have in

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
my head. then it will give me back a

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,079
more complete prompt with any missing

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,480
details and formatted in an ideal way

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,320
for image generators like midjourney

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,760
flux or any of the others. Now I have

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
this broken down into three parts. The

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
core purpose, prompt structure and tips,

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,080
then prompt examples for training. The

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,320
purpose lays out a highle overview of

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,840
what I'm looking for and how I want it

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,680
to respond. It assigns the role of

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
prompt enhancer, explains its purpose

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,760
and some of the basic most important

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
tips. Also tells it only to respond with

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
the enhanced prompt so it's easy to copy

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,759
and paste. I did put in there to use

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,600
best practices for AI image generation

42
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
because LLMs are already trained on

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,799
that, but I also have a big list of the

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,479
specific tips I'm looking for. Now, some

45
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,840
of these I got from Midjourney's

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
documentation on prompting tips. A lot

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,000
of it is tips I've curated. I made an

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,759
hourlong midJourney master class a while

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,360
back where I covered a lot of these.

50
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,799
This is a little long, so I won't cover

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,560
the whole thing, but it has examples of

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,479
how to be concise. Instead of show me a

53
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,159
picture of lots of blooming California

54
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
poppies, make them bright vibrant orange

55
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,759
and draw them in an illustrated style

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,680
with colored pencils. Instead of that,

57
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,439
use colored pencil illustration of

58
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,680
bright orange California poppies as

59
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
focus on what you want, not what you

60
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
don't want. Balance directness and

61
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
detail. Some of this was in the purpose

62
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,439
section, but it includes examples here.

63
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,360
And I have the prompt structure that

64
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
starts with a general overview of the

65
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
scene using recognizable archetypes and

66
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
keywords, subject details, setting

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,199
details, then style details. Then I

68
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,959
expanded on that with various examples

69
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,800
underneath all of those. Then the final

70
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,879
section is example prompts that use the

71
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,560
proper structure and formatting.

72
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,480
Including examples is called fshot

73
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
prompting in the prompt engineering

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,920
world. Providing examples of how you'd

75
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,000
like the LLM to respond can greatly

76
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
improve the output across all sorts of

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
applications beyond what I'm covering in

78
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,200
this video. I provided 12 different

79
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
prompts across various scenes and

80
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,080
styles. So that's the whole thing. It's

81
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,599
obviously easier to explain than it was

82
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,200
to write all this out and fine-tune it.

83
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
So I will link this in the description

84
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
if you'd like to use it. I encourage you

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
to modify it to your own preferences,

86
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,160
though. But it's a good base that should

87
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
save you a lot of time. So I'll show the

88
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
different ways to use this. Starting

89
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,879
with the easiest, just using it like a

90
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,720
prompt. So I have a new chat here. I

91
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,280
will just take this entire thing. I will

92
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
copy that and then paste it into the

93
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,959
prompt box and then send

94
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,400
that. Understood. Please proide your

95
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
initial prompt or idea for enhancement.

96
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,680
So I can just type in a concept, a

97
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,920
wizard casting a spell. Send that and

98
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
then it should respond with the enhanced

99
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,519
prompt. A bearded wizard in a flowing

100
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,599
deep blue robe stands at top a windswept

101
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,360
cliff. One hand raised as he casts a

102
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
glowing arcadan spell into the stormy

103
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,440
sky. Magical runes swirl around his

104
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,800
fingertips, crackling with blue and

105
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,640
violet energy. His eyes glow with power

106
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,159
beneath a wide-brimmed hat, and his

107
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
staff pulses with light. Dark clouds

108
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,760
churn above, lightning flashes in the

109
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
distance, dramatic fantasy lighting,

110
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
highdetail digital painting, cinematic

111
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,959
composition inspired by classical

112
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,799
fantasy art. So that's a much better

113
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
prompt. Then of course I could refine it

114
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
further from here, but let's try another

115
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,360
one. A robot in a forest studio Giblly

116
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,120
style. A gentle mosscovered robot stands

117
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,959
quietly in a lush sundappled forest

118
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,480
clearing surrounded by tall trees and

119
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
glowing wild flowers. It goes on from

120
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
there. You get the idea. That looks

121
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,879
great. And I will almost always take

122
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,560
these and modify them a little more from

123
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,480
here. But this helps a lot. You can also

124
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
ask to respond with multiple ideas. Then

125
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,080
you can mix and match the best bits from

126
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
each prompt. I built that into the core

127
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
instructions of the text to video prompt

128
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
enhancer that I'll cover next. I'll test

129
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
these out in Mid Journey really quick.

130
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
And so you can see, of course, this is

131
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
midjourney, so it's going to look cool

132
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
every time, but the first version has

133
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,040
just a wide variety and doesn't really

134
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,560
know exactly what to do with it. The

135
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,319
second version is a lot more fine-tuned

136
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,560
and all with a more specific pose, so

137
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
it's a far more controlled scene. And

138
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,918
same with the robot. All four of these

139
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,680
are quite a bit different. Then when we

140
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,199
scroll up, they're all a lot more

141
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,960
similar because it knows exactly what we

142
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
wanted from it. This method will work in

143
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,040
any LLM. Could be Claude, Gemini,

144
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,240
anything you want. Then you just come

145
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
back to the same chat anytime you need.

146
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But I prefer to do this as a project or

147
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
custom GPT. I like to have both options.

148
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
Actually, I will start with a project

149
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,440
and I'll just stick with chat GPT, but

150
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,360
projects work basically the exact same

151
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
way in Claude. So I go down and create a

152
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,080
new project. Give it a name, text image

153
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,759
enhancer, create project. Now I click

154
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
add instructions. Then I'll go back and

155
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,400
copy this first paragraph. Paste that

156
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
into the instructions. Save that. Now

157
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
I'll click add files. And I created this

158
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,560
file that has the prompting tips and

159
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,240
tricks and it also has the example

160
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,919
prompts for training. So I'm just going

161
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,840
to add that file in here. So I've got

162
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
that and now it's ready to go. I just

163
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,759
type in my basic prompt. A banana

164
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,800
wearing sunglasses on roller skates pop

165
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,000
art. There we go. A much better

166
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,600
prompt. These projects always stay up at

167
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
the top in this sidebar here so they're

168
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
easy to access. Then it keeps each of

169
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
the chats organized. So every time I

170
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
start a new one, they'll all pop up

171
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
under here. way better organization.

172
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
Then the other way to do this is with a

173
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
custom GPT, which has pros and cons, but

174
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,639
I'll show you how to do that really

175
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,199
quick. Just click on explore GPTs, then

176
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,199
create. And I'll do this custom. So I'll

177
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,520
click configure. I'll call it text to

178
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,560
image prompt enhancer. Type a short

179
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
description. Now I'll paste that same

180
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
paragraph into the instructions section.

181
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
Then in the knowledge section, I click

182
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
upload files and then upload that same

183
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,199
document. And I can have Dolly create a

184
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,479
quick image for this. That's all there

185
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,160
is to it. I'll give it a quick test. A

186
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,280
dancer under the moonlight.

187
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,479
Kirao. And there it is. Although that

188
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,199
one was a little

189
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,319
long. I can click create to finalize

190
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,919
that. Then I can go up here and make

191
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,520
sure it's pinned to my sidebar. That way

192
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
I can access it whenever I want. I like

193
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
to use projects most of the time so I

194
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,880
can find previous prompts if I need

195
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,800
them. But it is nice to have a GPT as

196
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
well because anytime I'm in an existing

197
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
chat, I can type at then I'm able to

198
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
select that GPT from the list. Now, when

199
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,199
I type a concept, it will use that GPT

200
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,960
to create the enhanced prompt in

201
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,400
whatever chat I was already in. I'll

202
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
still primarily use it in the project.

203
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,520
But once the instructions are already

204
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,280
created, it's just easy to copy and

205
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
paste it into a GPT, so might as well. I

206
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,039
used a lot of prompting techniques that

207
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,479
I've learned over the past couple years

208
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,160
to help with writing these. I learned

209
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,680
those through a lot of trial and error

210
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
and reading through pages and pages of

211
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,440
guides and documentation. If you want to

212
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,039
learn those prompt engineering concepts

213
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,120
in a much easier way than I did, there's

214
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,800
a free resource down in the description

215
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
provided by HubSpot, who sponsored this

216
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
video. It's titled AI Prompt Engineering

217
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
Quickstart Guide. It covers a three-step

218
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
framework for crafting perfect prompts.

219
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,560
As I've been covering in this video, the

220
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
quality of Chat GPT's output largely

221
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,479
depends on the quality of your prompt.

222
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
This guide will help you master prompt

223
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
engineering to get consistently great

224
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,919
results. It breaks down the three-step

225
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
framework, then gives some power tips

226
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,840
for better results. It also includes a

227
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,120
troubleshooting guide if you're still

228
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
struggling. Learning to communicate with

229
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,039
AI is a valuable skill that everyone is

230
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,639
in the process of learning right now.

231
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,080
This guide can help you speed up the

232
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,000
process. Again, that's a free download

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,759
using the link down in the description.

234
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,599
And thank you to HubSpot for sponsoring

235
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,840
this video. Now, I'll move on to text to

236
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,520
video. Now, this process is the same,

237
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,960
but the instructions are different. I'll

238
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,479
highlight just a few of the differences.

239
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,000
A big one is that the prompt structure

240
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,680
is different. That's because for video,

241
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
it's important to focus on the camera

242
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
movement. And in addition to my own

243
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
experimentation over the past couple

244
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,120
years, I primarily drew from Runway's

245
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,880
documentation on prompting, there were a

246
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,560
few other places, but Runways was the

247
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,840
most helpful. Now, for this one, I added

248
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
into the instructions to respond with

249
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,319
three enhanced prompt options. I prefer

250
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,000
that with text to video. Then I can pick

251
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,840
the best prompt and also use any

252
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
specific parts I liked from the others.

253
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,639
Then there was some prompt writing

254
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,960
guidelines and I have all the example

255
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,120
prompts below just like before. So I can

256
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
copy that and paste it all into a new

257
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,440
chat. Now I'll give it a test. I'll use

258
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,520
the same concept as before to see how it

259
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,400
changes. Right now, there's three

260
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
separate options that are each much

261
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,199
better than the one before. And I'll

262
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,879
make a quick project again, too. Name

263
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,720
it, paste the first part into the

264
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,479
instructions, and upload the knowledge

265
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,400
base into the files. Then, it's good to

266
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,159
go. I did also create a GPT for this

267
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,200
just using the same steps as

268
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
before. Now, I'll try running some of

269
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,919
these prompts through cling.

270
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:58,340
[Music]

271
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
Now I'll move on to the LLM prompt

272
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,240
enhancer which is like training Chad GPT

273
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
to prompt itself. I'm going to show a

274
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
general purpose prompt enhancer that

275
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,680
detects what type of thing you're

276
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,839
looking for and adjusts its responses

277
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,839
accordingly, but many people will have a

278
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
specific use case they come back to chat

279
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,920
GPT for regularly. You can also create a

280
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,600
more specialized version of this. I'll

281
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
show how to do that as well. Everyone is

282
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,399
going to have a different purpose for

283
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,160
theirs, but I'll show a detailed example

284
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
that I personally use. But starting with

285
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
this general purpose one, I'll go

286
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
through this section by section

287
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
explaining the logic here. So, I gave it

288
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
a role and explained its purpose. The

289
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
important parts of this are expanded on

290
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
below. This goes through multiple steps

291
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
which encourages it to use chain of

292
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,839
thought reasoning. Step one is determine

293
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,680
the best refinement approach. Analyze

294
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
the user's request and determine the

295
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,959
most effective way to improve clarity,

296
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,720
specificity, and structure. Choose the

297
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
appropriate approach based on the prompt

298
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,839
type. So, it needs to figure out the

299
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,080
best approach itself and adapt. Asking

300
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,920
to summarize an article is going to

301
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
warrant a very different response than

302
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,519
creative brainstorming or multi-step

303
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,120
instructions. So, I gave multiple

304
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,720
examples of how that would look. An

305
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,399
important part is this next section

306
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,480
about when the input lacks key details.

307
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
For a lot of prompts, context is

308
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,000
important and I may not have given all

309
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
the details necessary for it to respond

310
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
with the best prompt. In those cases,

311
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,680
it's supposed to realize that and ask

312
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
for the needed details. The next part

313
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,279
covers when to include asking for

314
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,200
different formats like tables, bullet

315
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,959
points, or JSON. Then there's

316
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
comparative analysis, multi-step

317
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,360
explanations, creative brainstorming.

318
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,959
This part was important. If the user

319
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,800
request involves idea generation or

320
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
innovation, apply an appropriate

321
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,240
thinking method, but do not force a

322
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,839
rigid framework. So, I use the example

323
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,600
of coming up with an invention or

324
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,200
innovation. There's different frameworks

325
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,920
people use. One is scamper, substitute,

326
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,079
combine, adapt, modify, put to another

327
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,000
use, eliminate, rearrange, but there's

328
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,279
multiple other approaches and

329
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,959
frameworks. So, I wanted it to think of

330
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,120
the best framework to use in any given

331
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,880
situation when it applies. This is one

332
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,079
of those areas where if you're making

333
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,920
this for a custom use case, you can ask

334
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,600
it to use the specific framework that's

335
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,760
best for that. Then step two is apply

336
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,440
industry standard prompt engineering

337
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
techniques only when needed. Most

338
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,040
effective prompt engineering techniques

339
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
are built into these models. Now, this

340
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,079
is just a reminder to use them in the

341
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,600
appropriate situations. Things like

342
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
fshot prompting, chain of thought

343
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,279
reasoning, self-consistency prompting,

344
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,959
role-based prompting, structured output

345
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,959
formatting. Again, just reminding it to

346
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,720
only use these when needed. They won't

347
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,399
apply to every prompt. And then step

348
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,399
three is deliver the final refined

349
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,079
prompt. There's a couple options here.

350
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,920
If the prompt is already clear, simply

351
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,519
refine it and provide the optimized

352
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
version. If additional information is

353
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
needed, ask only the most necessary

354
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
questions before refining the prompt. If

355
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
the request is overly broad but usable,

356
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,880
provide a refined version and mention

357
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
that more details could improve

358
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,399
accuracy. So that is the full prompt.

359
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,079
There's a lot in there, but it does work

360
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,000
pretty well for general purposes. So

361
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,720
I'll send that. How about explain coen

362
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
economics? I have no idea what that is,

363
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
but I saw someone mention it on Twitter

364
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
today. So that's the refined prompt with

365
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
a lot more. That seems pretty solid.

366
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,760
Let's see how that does. There we go.

367
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,440
Yeah, gave a pretty thorough answer. And

368
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,959
a good way to compare these side by side

369
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,480
is you can actually edit the prompt.

370
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
Then I'll write the more basic one.

371
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
Explain Koji and economics. And you can

372
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,920
see them right next to each other. Yeah,

373
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
it's just completely different answers.

374
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,040
I'll try out another example. What are

375
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
the most common programming languages?

376
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,480
Then it refineses a prompt and asks it

377
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,959
to respond with a markdown table. Then

378
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,800
there's how that answer would look. How

379
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
about one more? Give me app ideas I can

380
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,519
vibe code. Yeah, that one's great. Give

381
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
me a list of fun and creative app ideas

382
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,959
that are simple enough to vibe code.

383
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,720
Quick to prototype, minimal setup, and

384
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,040
fun to build solo. Focus on small scope,

385
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
original or quirky concepts, and room

386
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,880
for a playful UI or interactions.

387
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,480
Present that in a bulleted list with a

388
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,920
short one to two sentence description

389
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,200
for each. Yeah, that is perfect.

390
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,440
Those are some solid ideas. A bad advice

391
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,839
generator. A hype mirror. One second

392
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,279
sketch. That's pretty fun. Single

393
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,639
mysterious button that does something

394
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,959
new every day. A tomaga tweet that only

395
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,399
stays alive by tweeting or getting

396
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,079
engagement. Tiny compliment machine. All

397
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,279
right, there's some good ones in here.

398
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,720
Definitely did a good job with that one.

399
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
So, that works great and it's really

400
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,160
good to have, but most people will have

401
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,240
a couple very specific use cases they

402
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
prompt regularly for. In those

403
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
situations, it's best to make a

404
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
specialized version of this rather than

405
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,399
a general purpose one. One thing that I

406
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
use chat GPT for a lot is creative

407
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,079
brainstorming. And even that is too

408
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,920
broad a topic. So an even more specific

409
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,000
example is scripting short form content.

410
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,120
So I'll jump into the instructions

411
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
first, then show it in practice. This

412
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
project will be used step by step. When

413
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,320
I paste an article, tweet or concept,

414
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
you will respond with step two. I will

415
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,519
select a hook, then you will respond

416
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,279
with step three, and so on. We go step

417
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,040
by step as a back and forth. And I have

418
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
a bunch of steps all listed out in depth

419
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,240
here. Step one is just the initial

420
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
input. Then step number two is hook

421
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,240
ideas. There's 16 different categories

422
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,320
like shocking statistic, intriguing

423
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
question, bold statement,

424
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,560
counterintuitive fact, and then 12 more.

425
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,120
And over under project files, I uploaded

426
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,360
a file that had three examples for each

427
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,920
of these 16 hook types. I created this a

428
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,600
long time ago and could not find the

429
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,120
original document anymore. And it

430
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
doesn't let me open it up in here. I

431
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,920
have no idea where that went, but that's

432
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,600
what this document was. But back to the

433
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,279
instructions. Once I select a hook, it

434
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,040
will give me visual hook ideas. Then it

435
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,480
will give me key bullet points for the

436
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
script. The next step is to give ideas

437
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,959
for curiosity gaps, unexpected twists,

438
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,120
escalating reveals. This is all just to

439
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
help with brainstorming. It will have a

440
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,160
big list of ideas in different

441
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
directions. Some of the time I won't use

442
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,279
any of them, but it will give me an

443
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,959
idea. And then the next part is the

444
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,480
rough script outline. Then some closing

445
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
statement ideas like a call to action,

446
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,920
loop creation, thoughtprovoking

447
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,519
question, cliffhanger, and then there's

448
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,040
a final review. So that's a quick

449
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,959
breakdown of how this works. Now I'll

450
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,480
demonstrate it. How about we do the

451
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,040
topic of this video, the secret to

452
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,000
endless prompts. How to use Chat GPT to

453
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,920
enhance any prompt idea into the most

454
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,040
effective

455
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,560
prompt. And so this is the hook ideas,

456
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,880
right? Shocking statistic. 95% of people

457
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,959
are using Chat GPT wrong and missing out

458
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,880
on its most powerful feature. What if

459
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,800
your boring AI prompt could become a

460
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
viral masterpiece with one tweak? You

461
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,399
don't need creativity. You need this

462
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
Chat GPT trick. The best Chat GPT

463
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,160
prompts don't come from AI experts. They

464
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
come from beginners who know this

465
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
secret. What if one sentence could

466
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,000
unlock an infinite stream of high

467
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,519
performing AI prompts? Think of your

468
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
prompt like a seed. Chadip is the one's

469
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,040
not very good. I used to spend hours

470
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
stuck on a single idea until I

471
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,760
discovered the trick that turned Chad

472
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,839
GBD into my personal creative director.

473
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,120
All right, so it keeps going. There's 16

474
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,320
of those. Let's go with the

475
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,000
counterintuitive fact number

476
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,360
four. So that gives me the hook. Then it

477
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
also has a refined hook. So it's just

478
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
another option with the same idea. With

479
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,079
short form, you want to have a visual

480
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,279
hook as well. They want to grab

481
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,720
attention with what you're saying as

482
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
well as what they're seeing on the

483
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,120
screen. So, it has a couple ideas for

484
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
those. Let's go with number one. So, it

485
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,279
gives me some key points for the script.

486
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,279
The problem with overengineering. Many

487
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,959
people assume better prompts equals more

488
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,800
complexity. Experts tend to overload

489
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
their prompts trying to sound smart.

490
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,079
Then key point two, what beginners

491
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,079
accidentally get right. Honestly, that

492
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,839
sounds really engaging. Then key point

493
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,360
three, the one trick that changes

494
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
everything. We'll say that sounds good

495
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
and move on to step five. And there's a

496
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,720
big list of things I could include. Some

497
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
curiosity gaps. Most people think they

498
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320
know how to prompt chatbt, but they're

499
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,480
missing this. Unexpected twists.

500
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,560
Escalating reveals. There's relatable

501
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
analogies. This one's pretty good. It's

502
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,680
like talking to a genie. If you're too

503
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,839
vague or too specific, it backfires.

504
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,040
That's really good, actually.

505
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,120
Challenging assumptions. Most tutorials

506
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
over complicate prompting. Future

507
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,560
implications. If you can master this one

508
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,920
trick, you'll never run out of ideas

509
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,839
again. Cliffhers for various sections.

510
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,279
Like, and here's the one tweak that

511
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,800
changes everything. An interactive

512
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,959
element like an on-creen poll. say I

513
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
like the second curiosity gap, the genie

514
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,400
analogy, and the second

515
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,600
[Music]

516
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,399
cliffhanger. I'll just say that looks

517
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,920
good and move on. There's some final

518
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,680
ideas to wrap it up with. Let's do

519
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,440
number one. Then I have the full script

520
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,040
outline with some different wording I

521
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,560
can use. So, I never have it write the

522
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,920
entire script for me. I like to write it

523
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,440
in my own voice, but it gives a bunch of

524
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,800
bullet points and ideas for me to work

525
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
from. Now, I wanted to walk through

526
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,440
every step of that so you can see how

527
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,199
effective and time-saving these can be.

528
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,880
Like, there was some amazing ideas in

529
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,160
there. I never would have thought of

530
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,839
myself. Like the comparison to a genie.

531
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,440
I still really like that one. So figure

532
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
out what it is you do that is the most

533
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
timeconuming or repetitive and see if

534
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,800
you can work out a system like this for

535
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,560
yourself. Or use chatbt to help you

536
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
create that system. Use that prompt

537
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,839
generator and ask it for a prompt to

538
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,440
help you create it. So you can save a

539
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,040
ton of time for yourself this way. And

540
