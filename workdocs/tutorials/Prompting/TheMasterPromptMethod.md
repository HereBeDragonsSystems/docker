today we're diving deep into the future of business operations with Hayden a
serial entrepreneur who's using AI not just as a tool but as a core operating
system for building scaling and protecting his companies you'll learn how the master prompt method is changing
the rules turning AI from a flashy assistant into a strategic partner that
drives real exponential growth if you're serious about surviving and thriving in
the AI first era that we're entering you're going to want to watch this all the way through and if you stay till the
end we'll teach you how to build your master prompt step by step let's get into

it welcome to the channel Hayden thanks for having me Tuggo how are you spending your your time these days when it comes
to to AI yeah I work pretty long days um typically wake up around 4:30 and spend
the first 5 hours or so of the day just learning and typically playing with AI i
have a several businesses so typically over the last decade I've probably spent
40 hours a week or so learning something tinkering with it and if it works uh
attempting to systematize it and then teach it to all my leadership teams so when you say leadership teams plural um
what are the different kinds of businesses that you're involved in right now and how so I have three different holding companies um and between those
holding companies we've got probably like 30 active businesses i'd say
twothirds of those were acquired onethird of those were started each of those businesses has a CEO each of the
holding companies has a CEO and the businesses run a really wide gamut so we've got one holding company that's
really a lot of brickandmortar so HVAC plumbing roofing um we've got another holding company that's a lot of digital
stuff when you think of what's going on with AI right now your time I think it's
safe to say is is limited and in demand what makes AI worth spending like you
said four five plus hours per day learning experimenting with and and and
uh figuring out I firmly believe that AI can potentially double to triple every
single one of my companies per year that's how big I think it is um typically leadership teams up until now
have been setting goals to have like 30 to 50% year-over-year growth right
that's can be considered sustainable growth and I think some of the scalable companies that I mentioned I think you
can 10x that today with AI i mean it takes a lot of work don't get me wrong
um and I think some of the less scalable ones so more of the brick and mortar where a lot of the fulfillment is done in person I still think you know instead
of 30 to 50% a year I think probably six to 100% growth per year is is doable say
a little bit about um Acquire and Empower which are two of your companies um Acquire is a business that helps
people basically become acquisition entrepreneurs typically buying a million dollar a year cash line business that's
in profit um financing them through SBA loans uh and then Empower is working
more on the seller side so we're helping doing exit planning uh for sellers and
kind of connecting the two and how many how many people have you worked with or across how many businesses or
acquisitions have you have you worked on uh a bunch uh definitely over hundred um
I think we had like six closes last quarter um and we probably had
about sort of working with another 50 people and on the seller side we probably talked to thousands of sellers
off market when you say the valuation drivers um which of those valuation drivers does
AI affect all of them all of them every single one yeah every single one
different ones I would say have so you know I said you can get like two you
know three to 5x growth in some areas and maybe 2x growth in others so I think
marketing for example you can have massive growth um sales today you on the actual sales side AI
can help a lot with things like call reviews pipeline management um
autoresponders it can make probably a manager maybe three times more effective right so a sales manager might have 25
to 30 reports they can remove a lot of the reporting a lot of the that people don't like doing but it can't
currently take calls right so you're still limited by someone actually taking
the calls now that might change in the next year or two um
operations things like creating process things like all of that is so much faster uh it removes a lot of the
monotony mhm um but there's still a level of training and buy in uh that you
know takes a lot of work so what is the master prompt method so basically when you prompt you want to be able to give

the AI as much detailed instruction and context as possible if you do a simple
one-s sentence prompt and you've got no other context the answer you're going to get is going to be no better than really a Google answer in most cases and so
some people do start that way and they prefer to make turn it into a conversation right so do you know do
this for me and then it gets back okay now make it this way okay and now make it this way so they kind of look at like it's a Google on chatbot right and then
so that's kind of your first introductory level and the second level up after that would be you've probably all seen like an Instagram reel where
someone says like copy this prompt and it's a super long thing right yeah um and you are my executive coach and you
won't take any from me and it's like then it becomes super mean
and so we've all seen that what the master prompt is was basically how can I give full context for in my case for my
business every single time I prompt without having to write anything um and I first thought of this when like Chad
GPD first came out with memories right the way memories worked was it was just
you know one at a time you had to ask it to remember it right and eventually after you used it a lot it became really
really useful but just the way it worked it probably took like you know hundreds of conversations to get to that point
and I found myself always saying "Remember this remember this remember this." Right and then I found then I
started playing with other tools and I found that um Claude basically had these
account preferences uh that let you put in effectively like all of the memories
so I actually had chatbt export all of its memories uh and put it into cloud
and then it it uses that and accesses that every time um I ask it anything
right so it now has the full context of my business and so I worked on developing that out developing that out for each of my companies uh and then
sharing it with my leadership teams and showing them how to use it and this one prompt would maybe be like on a Google doc 30 pages long right and those 30
pages are being accessed every single time you type something in so once you do that it's just night and day that
type of response you get and you just continually iterate and iterate and it
just gets better and better one more question before we look at uh a couple different uh kind of case studies what
is the impact that it has like why why does why is it important why does it matter what difference does it make to
have a master prompt you get more done better and faster quality of the out of
your work improves drastically like there's some stats around quality improving 40% the productivity the
amount of work one person does uh improves drastically and you can get it
out faster so literally it's all three right and that all comes from more and
better context more and better context and the fact that it's AI what would take you
know someone two weeks to put together everything you need to to really do a
thorough job uh of something now takes you know under an hour and so what I
what I find really interesting is and what will happen is that there will be a democratization of execution so and it's
going to take a different amount of time depending on what industry you're in and how adaptable um the industry is um so
like the brick and mortar stuff will probably take several years um but some of the digital stuff software marketing
um legal finance that stuff will probably move much faster because of this you can take you can do very
thorough things that typically only very large companies have the resources to do
uh in very little time so sort of narrowing the difference or the gap
between the small companies and the large companies yeah democratization of execution let's get into both some real
life demos and then we're going to actually teach you how to build the first version of your master prompt for
you and your company or organization so watch till the
end all right so now we've moved to the computer and we are looking now at your

claude account say a little bit about why you have chosen to use cloud for this i use claude because it has this
basically setting preference that lets you basically put in this it's called personal preferences um that lets you
put in everything about your company so this goes into every single prompt and then the other reason I use cloud is
that it also has projects and these projects um for example can when you go
in it has a sources right and so these sources over here also have project
knowledge and I can share these projects with other people whenever I make a prompt from within this project it uses
not only what's in the settings but it also uses everything that's within this project knowledge and if I can share
this project with other people so notebook element it's kind of like this is like notebook LM with a separate notebook for everyone um what notebook
Ellen doesn't have is this sort of preferences thing and and that's your master prompt basically could we see
that again real quick sure just to give people a little preview so this is that you said 20 or 30 page doc that has all
the context about this particular business yep so I I share this with everyone on the team and I always ask
them to uh just update this part right so obviously this is me and this is my position i'm the founder also some
personal stuff right shows what my strengths are also shows what my weaknesses are and I also have a how I
want AI to help me i hope to be able to use AI and technology to fill in for the weakness which is driving accountability
keeping everything on schedule internal communication not doing things that I don't like doing these are the co key
focus areas again this is for acquir uh and empower together in one it's not we have separate ones for different businesses then we have like business
structure stuff which I don't often use we have sort of what of our what our products are it's like a compendium of
knowledge about this business yeah so you know what I used to use and was we had what was a goo a big Google doc that
I just called our executive um library and I just put everything in there now
this is kind of the same but it's also NI so yeah so it shows our salesunnel and our conversion metrics our sales
process our timing of closes our qualification um our workshops this is all stuff on
our team who's on the team what's the cost of each team and this is where we're going to show people in a minute
to create for themselves at least the first version exactly yeah and some of the the pieces that matter at the end
are sort of more like so we're going to show how to do this but so for example 131 is something I've used in all of my businesses uh whenever I ask for one I'm
asking you to help a decision-making framework in which you determine the problem the outcome and provide three potential paths and one recommended
course of action and then I always ask it to ask five questions one at a time um to get what you need to do this and answer each question based on what you
know about the business and situation present your answer and allow me to edit it or approve it before you proceed to the next question it's not just uh
literal factual information about the business like you would find in a business directory it's like frameworks
that you use yep yeah so all of these are like we're going to show how what
this actually creates this AI hiring one um so this is one prompt uh AI CMO we
can show that as well aisp we can show that as well they're sort of like almost like mini programs that you write
protocols yeah they're like little protocols um and like the nice thing about LLMs is that they are you know you
multimodal so you can take a screenshot and put it in you can you know take all sorts of stuff and put it in so a
project you mentioned is just really just a conversational interface to a set of documents exactly right yeah so it's
almost like it's adding to the master prompt but just for those things so in this project for example this is on this
is all related to um the seller funnel and us working with sellers and not
working with buyers so there's no reason for me to put this in the master prompt that all people on the buyer side of the
business will use might even get confusing and pull the wrong info exactly it's almost like you want this
global context but then you actually want silos yep you want little enclaves of protected information that aren't
shared universally yep and how about um the sharability you mentioned if you
have someone working with you on one of these projects you can share it with them yep you can share chats uh and you can share projects and if you share a
project can they have their own conversation with that project yep and do you have access to that conversation
or it's it's private to them i believe I do um I don't really use it like that
very often and chatbt just as a point of comparison at least on the day we're recording this you can create a project
but you can't share that project with anyone right yeah when I first looked into chat GPT for these options it was a
bunch of different things that it couldn't do um the master prompt is another one chat GPT can't do it gemini
has gems and they just don't work properly mhm uh at least right now as of April 29th at 4:46 p.m
uh and uh the only two that are kind of options for this are are Notebook LM and
Claude i find that Claude is just a little bit better for just share general
sharability um but notebook all right so this was a good introduction to how you use Claude let's look at a couple use
cases so what are some examples of of uh problems you were trying to solve or
things you were trying to build that were either way faster or way more effective or profitable or whatever it
is because of because of the master prompt method in AI ai like I said is can democratize execution meaning even
small enterprises even you know a one-person company can now take on a
process that would be typically reserved for a company the size of GM right and so one hiring practice that um we use in
our companies uh is top grading and top grading is a lot of work uh you have to
you know obviously the cliche of you know hiring slow and firing fast definitely exists but you put in a ton
of effort you have way more interviews um and then you also measure um much
more uh regularly do you want to do this without the master prompt first or I can
if you like sure so yeah this has no no personal preferences just kind of a
blank account um so let's say I I just want to say uh uh I want to hire a
marketing director or acquire a help so you can see interesting i have
to go back it's like all right well give me context right what does acquire do what are the key responsibilities what
are the specific qualifications or experience you're looking for so it's basically kind of like if I have to type all this out I'm basically someone's
just typing for me right right or you know adding some words in okay okay so if I go to my
version here I just say do AI hiring for
marketing director and AI hiring is like a trigger word that activates that protocol yeah so that's one of the words
I had in my in my master and when you say acquirer that one word it knows
everything about acquir yeah so first is ask me questions this
is what I have it programmed to do and it answers its own question so what are the primary responsibilities of this
market by the way we don't have a marketing director require um so it's interesting that it kind of understands this um so leading overall marketing
strategy generate leads for both of our programs managing our multi- channelannel marketing approach it knows it's emails a AI agent texting and paid
ads overseeing content creation for nurturing our list directing both buyer side and seller side marketing efforts
managing marketing team that includes blah blah blah so I mean this is perfect so I'll just say yes yeah
all right right so now it's just going to create a job descript this is the other thing I really like about Claude is it
has these things called artifacts um and you'll see it'll it'll create
multiple in a second but notice how over here it's doing exactly what I mentioned
so it's got the responsibility it's got the market the metric to measure and it's got our quarterly target for each
one of these and again we don't actually have this position so it's making some assumptions here mh uh it's got the A player versus B player performance
across all of these um it's got the month one outcomes the month two outcomes the month three and beyond outcomes it's got what the ideal
background when you've done this in the past you've gone through this in great detail and really verified it yeah i
mean we we can go through it that typically the things that will that I will always look at will be like
specifically this and like the targets make sure they're accurate this would have taken our HR director a bunch of
time to create like how much time would you estimate so each of it's creating a lot of artifacts right now so this is
probably the hardest one um this would probably take the better part of a week
simply because you have to have meetings with in this case whoever the direct report or the direct manager would be
which would probably be like the CEO mhm right because we don't have like a a VP there that's multiple meetings and
multiple reviews and then also just at least a couple days of work putting it putting it together so okay that that's
one thing um this is right here is the recruitment materials so it creates
again this is part of the prompt in AI hiring it creates uh a screening
interview uh criteria so obviously we're going to put out um job ads and we don't
want to have to interview every single person so it asks for a cover letter it defines what should be in that cover
letter and it based on it being able to screen and score so that when we actually do interviews uh we don't we
only do it with people above 20 out of 30 to advance uh and so this here are
some of the sample questions uh here's if we email to our list about the role
uh here is a job posting for external sites um and then here is if people pass
that screening interview here's what the working interviews would be mhm so in a
position like this we'd probably have a couple working interviews with a couple people um so we'd have one here this
just what it's recommending marketing funnel optimization another is email marketing revitalization a third is new product
launch marketing plan uh it also gives we always do homework for managers or above um and so basically giving us a
couple options for homework to give them this always took me a ton of time to think about like good homework for a role and they're always really good
um and then again this is like top grading would do all of these things
most people in a company of like 30 to 40 people like Acquir you wouldn't do
this you'd just be like "Yep looks like he can type on a keyboard." I mean give
him a chance yeah it's like for a company already like a massive multinational already doing top grading
this is like okay more efficiency faster time but for I mean I'm thinking of my company which is much even much smaller
five people we would simply not do anything like this we would be like oh we know a guy who does this so and so
and just invite him invite him on and like what's the difference so so the difference might be that you know
a let's say 50% more people in this method are a players mhm right then in
your method so you take two companies two ident two identical companies going at the same motion you maybe need to
make if you're growing maybe year one you make three hires um maybe one of
yours works out and two of mine work out that's right huge but that's huge and now next year because two of mine work
out I need to make six hires and you need to make three hires and now four of mine work out and one of your like that
just it's a divergence it's huge because companies really it is about people right nowadays because you can do this
like this in my opinion will become common place again it'll depend on the
industry and how much people use AI it'll probably take many years before every small business is doing it but
there's no reason in my opinion why should people shouldn't do this right now everybody watching this video should do this this was an awesome example um
let's look at a different one let's look at kind of the opposite like something operations related in all my
companies another thing that is I'd say we do at a smaller size than most
companies because it's I think it's really important to get consistency across the board is fulfillment engines
um but they're basically flowcharts of process uh and so this is a process that we use uh and in one of our products
basically to um you know someone pays money they get onboarded and we start searching for a business for them and it
kind of starts here at us receiving money and it ends this just this part ends at getting uh an LOI a letter of
intent a letter of intent counter signed by a seller right and so there's kind of two mark two paths to it there's on market and offmarket we do both um at
the same time effectively like this is a good onboarding tool for people because and it's also just good a good tool for
your onboarding of customers as well as your employees and then it's also like each of these actually links to process
right and SOPs and checklists right and I think everyone knows they should do this but it's a pain in the ass you have
to be like a a certain kind of weird to enjoy it um which I'm not and my
daughter is she loves it but check this out so I'm just going to take a screenshot any chat here and just to
test this out i'm going to say what is this let me paste it in the screenshot okay it says this appears to
be a process flow diagram for the A+ program onboarding and deal sourcing workflow
um it's describing it to me accurately mhm so I'm just going to say do AI SOP
where we stop which is another protocol yeah another protocol that we define in the master prob this one is like two
paragraphs right which starts with whenever I say AOS SOP
and so what it's now doing is it's taking every single step here and it's turning it's basically creating the SOP
for it uh now you can go even further and you can actually have if you have
Claude make this flowchart for you uh and then have it do it um I personally
prefer when we're teaching companies I personally prefer to actually do this manually just so people really think
about it um because I think that piece does require some brain power what's the
impact of being able to document a process like this what what difference does it make uh accountability mhm it's
probably the biggest difference accountability for for employees to to follow the process to follow the process
yeah uh there's never you know if if something doesn't get done there's only
a few reasons why that happens right um either they didn't know it needed to be
done um they didn't know how to do it or they weren't bought in to do it right
and so this completely eliminates the first two right you know it needs to
be done and you know how to do it I guess and on the buy in it helps a lot it's much easier to understand what
you're helping achieve and what your role is in it and so actually we have
these things called clarity boards so if you go back to like this other one that I did here right um by the way I always
have at least three chats going on at once while I wait for AI um so in this
one right here like what we do is we have like a clarity board which has all of these on separate um it's like a
one-stop shop for employees and it also has a fulfillment engine for that employment employee just what they need
to do right it's almost like an employee handbook or a man a manual in a way
that's also included the actual employee handbook's included in it as well m um do you ever find that the the people in
your companies following this do they ever ask the AI for help if they get stuck on one of the steps or somewhere
in the process they absolutely can i just want to like stress that that each one this is just it's a pain to do
they're very accurate like they're actually when I reviewed these they were more accurate than the first reviews I
did when they were actually made because for Acquir we made these maybe a year ago a little under a year ago and it
took months to do and it was a lot of work for a lot of people right um because and then you have someone who
has to own the SOP this right here was probably the replacement of at least
three months of work mhm now there's still part of the challenge now is like
how do you get buy in because sometimes when someone has spent months working on it like they just need to get buy in
because it was so much work uh and now so sometimes you can see that people care a
little bit less because the effort wasn't there sops and documentation is so interesting because it's it's important for companies of all sizes
like I can I can imagine a massive corporation needing to do that but also in our tiny team of five the only way we
can run our company with so few people is with really good documentation it's like every person in our team on our
team has five hats that they wear and they to switch between those roles they need they need you know notes and
documentation so that's that's a the solution you showed is one that encompasses a super wide variety of
companies and organizations yep and it's just one example right this if you
recall in my preference when I said what my weaknesses were it was exactly this and I said I want AI to help me with
this and so that's how I use it but I think as people use it they're going to
find even more use cases again just with an LLM going back and forth and the the
thing that I really encourage is whenever so it's a couple things um when you're using Claude I always encourage
you to ask Claude to ask you questions and then if you have a master prompt I always encourage like answer your own
question based on what you know and then stop and let me look at it just to save you time so you don't actually have to type anything um and then you also are
able to see what does Claude not actually understand correctly right and then you can go back and change the
master prompt interesting right so that's part of the iterative process say a little bit about how this is impacting
the structure of teams or the size of teams or the roles on those teams i think there will be no director layer at
all um and I think the manager layer will probably expand like so typically
you kind of had like this a 50 person company would have sort of seven um sort
of front-facing technicians right um for every manager and so you'd have seven
people to seven managers to like you know let's call it one CEO and so that's a 50 person structure and when you think
about that like from a from a headcount ratio perspective um it's not bad right
you've got effectively 42 people um being paid that are revenue generating
and you have eight people that are supporting however getting to that stage
is a ton of work and so there's there's this stage everyone some people call it the valley of death some people call it
the swamp right and it's the stage where you're kind of you're still too small to
be able to afford to like hire that layer of management and so the only real way to overcome it is you either take a
risk and do a hire with with all your profit or stop paying yourself or you work way more hours or you do both and
so to get to that 50 of efficiency most of the companies that we're buying actually have about 25 30 employees and
it becomes super inefficient so you end up having maybe 12 or 13 sort of front
level techs and then you end up having like five managers and like two people that
wear like four hats and so it ends up being really inefficient and maybe in a in your previous company or in your
current company you have something like that where I c I mean I certainly have
and so what I think will happen is you will just have the front level people right just the people actually doing the
workney Yeah and depending on the business plumbers HBAC like you need actual
people to go to someone's house right you need cars you're limited to the number of you know hours they have in a
day um but what you sell you sell an info product right and actually you sell an info product without sales so
actually it could be you could have almost infinite amount of revenue coming in with very very few employees right
yeah um and so that's why we have we have two portfolios one portfolio is like will
not be replaced by technology but will not scale at like 5x a year and then we
have the other portfolio that's like scale like crazy um but you're going to be competing with other people who are
scaling like crazy interesting so yeah long answer to your question i think
you're going to have far larger companies with far fewer employees ai will be all your director layer will be
your CEO layer um it will just be basically owner and then front level
people so if you're still watching at this point you want to do this you
understand the context you understand the impact you understand the implications I really want you to try
this for yourself so we are going to move over to the flip chart and teach you how to come up with at least the V1
of your master prompt ready let's do it so I'm going to assume you work in an

organization of some kind like a company you might be a manager a director a VP a
CEO or even the owner how would someone working in an organization or company like that get started with the master
prompt method yeah so I would first probably just create a Google doc um and I'd start creating some sections and so
I think the first section would be personal info pardon my writing i was a doctor in a former life
so outside of your name um this is going to be like what's your role what company do you work in how do
you want to use AI what are your strengths what are your weaknesses that will help AI kind of personalize and
give it the context that you need okay next obviously we need some company info
um so here is like when was the company established
how many employees does it have who if it's part of the personal like who do you report to and then some
important questions about like what markets do they serve who is their ideal
customer what products and services do they have so each of these questions and
we can go over them but each of these questions I actually recommend if you don't know the answer actually just talk
to AI right and so if you don't know who they serve perfectly just literally you
know type a message like hey help me determine who our ideal client u profile
is totally right and take their answer like put it in a separate artifact take their answer copy and paste it in your
Google Google doc when you're happy with it um so yeah that's the that's the who right there's also like the what which
is like what do you do right um what is the outcome that you're effectively
trying to give to your customer and again you can if if you don't know exactly how to phrase that it's probably
good to actually chat back and forth use AI as a thought partner third is that is the how right so how do you do it and
how is that different from your competitors so then I would say like market information who are your
competitors is a good one um what do they do i especially if you're in
marketing that's super useful for each of these sections is there like a minimal length you would look for like a
word count or what level of detail honestly a paragraph is probably fine
um any level of detail is better than none yeah uh and what you may find is as
you work back and forth with Claude or Notebook LM or whatever you may decide that based on the results you may decide
you know that wasn't perfect and so I'm going to go and add a little bit more info so I would actually just recommend
everything I talked about maybe write like one to two sentences outside of market this is going to be more than five uh we have uh people or team who's
on the team right if you're the owner of a small business I would actually just talk about you know who reports to you
who reports to each of those people if you want to bring finance into this and you can make financial decisions uh you
can put that stuff in just keep in mind if you're going to share this with people on your team you might there may be some stuff you don't want to share i
like to put team plus APIs so for each person what is their one number which is
super important um again if you don't know then ask Claude hey you know this
person does this i need to figure out what would be the best KPI for them and then products and services so this I'll
um talk about all of the products including potentially planned products what do they cost what are their
features what are the benefits and like that's a great start those five things
um the the last thing that especially for someone who's a business owner or someone in a leadership position I would
say would be like culture and this is quite
important because culture which would include core values right it's a kind of
like a who is on the bus right um mission
all of that stuff will kind of define everything you do in each of these and
like the AIS SAP for example our core values require our serve right systematic excellence which you probably
see a lot and what I'm talking about um is the S and so it knows whenever we say
we want to create an SOP it knows to do that when we do an email to the list it knows to do that when we create content
it knows to mention our core values and ultimately that's kind of what creates and positions you in your market and
people who share those values kind of orient towards become true fans so culture is really
important so those things it's so important i'm just going to put a little little subheader here
so I would say core values if you don't know them cloud's
really good at helping you identify them mission um be hag is a nice one it's
like your big hairy audacious goal right and then the the final thing which is maybe outside of the scope of this video
um would be the actual kind of prompts right and and a lot of that can be tailored to your business right so the
AI SOP the um AI hiring right and as you
and again you just figure that out as you keep on going maybe you read a book and you really like some concept and you
think to yourself how can I implement this into the master prompt oh fascinating oh that's such a good So it's like sometimes you're reading a
book you're like I wish I could just like install this book like a software program into my business and now you can
yeah yeah i played with some stuff too about like you know there's like what would Jesus do right or what would this
ex business person do right it's so easy to do with AI right just prompt it
because it has all the information about the Yeah right what about like goals or strategy does that figure into here as
well for sure um the only reason I wouldn't put this in in your first master prompt is as you use AI any goals
and strategy you have today are most likely going to change massively um as
you kind of explore and realize what AI is capable of uh I know for ourselves
you know we used to I mean we used to plan three years in advance m I've gone down to 6 months in advance just because
I've noticed that technology shifts um just make new things possible mhm um I
know at the beginning of I was looking at like my 2024 goals that we shared with our
leadership team uh and it had like the 2-year goals and so like three year
goals 2024 25 26 I was looking at the 2026 number and today like in 2020 25
our 2026 number is like four times what it was back then mostly because of AI mostly all because of AI like it's only
in the last year last six months really that that changed mass massively wow okay that's a great piece of advice
don't don't put in free AI plans that you expect to come to
fruition i'd love if you give this a try if you could share with us in the
comments below what you found how did it go what were the wins what were the obstacles we'll do our best to respond
to those comments and guide you further but otherwise uh thanks for being a guest on the channel and teaching us
what you know hayden I would also love to know in the comments if you are able to use this in something that's not
business what kind of master prompt did you create and like what kind of uh sections did you put in it that'd be
really interesting to me i hope that was interesting i hope it was valuable and most of all I hope it was helpful you
can find out much more about the master prompt method and the new program that we're teaching called Second Brain
